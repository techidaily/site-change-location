- **Accessing sketchy links.**Clicking on strange or suspicious links in messages or emails is the number one virus source.
- **Downloading apps from unauthorized developers.**Getting apps from places other than the official app stores like Google Play or Apple Store can also be a gateway for trojan viruses. This is mainly because apps install files directly to your system when downloaded.
