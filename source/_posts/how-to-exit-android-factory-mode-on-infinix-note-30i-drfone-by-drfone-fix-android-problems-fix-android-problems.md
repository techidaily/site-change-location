## How to Exit Android Factory Mode On Infinix Note 30i?

You’ve often heard that recovery mode will solve just about any problem your Infinix Note 30i is experiencing. This is mostly true and one of the components of Android’s recovery mode, factory mode or [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/wipe-data-factory-reset.html) is one of the most efficient ways to solve various problems on your device. While factory mode is often a good thing, there are times when your device can enter factory mode on its own. Other times, you can safely enter factory mode but not know how to get out.

Fortunately for you, this article will explain all aspects of factory mode and especially how to safely exit factory mode.

If your device charges normally, it means there is a problem is with your adapter, and you must replace it at the earliest to solve My Infinix Note 30i won't charge the issue.
