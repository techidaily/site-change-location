### App Troubles

If your **phone is working, but the screen is black,** there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application. An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.

### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software. This problem suggests that your Samsung Galaxy S24+ is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately. If this is the cause, then your device is likely experiencing a critical system error, and you should directly try to reboot your phone.

### Hardware Problem

If you dropped your phone, there’s a high chance the LCD connectors went loose due to the physical impact. If this happened to you, the phone might be working, but the screen is black due to the LCD cable dislodging. Another issue could be your phone got exposed to extreme temperatures. This can also cause a **black screen but your phone is still on.**

## Ways to Unbrick Your Android Device: Various Ways for Recovery

When your Samsung Galaxy S24+ becomes unresponsive or frozen after mistakenly flashing a ROM or rooting, you are informed that the phone has been bricked. The most terrifying aspect will not just be gadget loss, but also data erasure. However, what exactly is a bricked phone, and, more importantly, how do you fix a bricked Android phone?

This article will explain what a **bricked android phone** is, why an Android phone becomes bricked, how to unbrick an Android phone without losing data and a third-party application you can use.

## Part 1. Causes of Bricked Phones

In everyday settings, our mobile devices have become our greatest friends, therefore breaking your phone is the last thing you want to do. There are different reasons why devices brick, and we must be familiar with them in order to comprehend the various techniques to repair bricked devices.

Here are some common reasons why your Samsung Galaxy S24+ is bricked:

- **Flashing Stock/Custom ROM:**It is possible that you installed an incompatible ROM in the Android phone, that the phone shuts off during the process, or that you have performed other errors that cause your phone to restart indefinitely or to become stuck at the starting screen.
- **Rooting an Android device:**You are unable to effectively root the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device.
- **Android firmware is being updated:**If the phone is interrupted when updating the Android firmware, it will be bricked.
- **Installing harmful applications:**You installed harmful programs on your Samsung Galaxy S24+, or the phone was infected with a virus.

## Part 2. How to Fix a Bricked Phone

The first step is to establish how badly your device is bricked. In most cases, you will be working with soft bricks that are pretty simple to repair. If your phone is stuck in a boot loop or enters recovery mode every time you turn it on, you may have a soft brick.

To repair bricked Android phones and tablets, you must first thoroughly examine the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device's state. Before you begin troubleshooting, determine the sort of bricking that your phone is experiencing. However, there is no specific software to unbrick your Samsung Galaxy S24+; you may need to learn the complexities of this issue or hire a professional to do it for you.

### Method 2. Wipe the Cache Partition

This is the first indication that a user's phone has gone bricked. The phone turned on automatically, however it became stuck or frozen on the logo screen. The issue might be caused by the undeleting of data and cache, which prevents the phone from displaying the home screen.

This issue, however, may be resolved by wiping the data and cache partitions in recovery mode. You must do the following to do this:

- **Step 1:** Turn off your smartphone and enter recovery mode by pressing the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously. Different devices have various approaches for entering recovery mode, so you may perform better.
- **Step 2:** After entering recovery mode, you should see the screen below. Remember to pick Advanced and then “Wipe Dalvik Cache” if your device is under Clockwork Mod recovery. Return to the main screen and select “Wipe Cache Partition” once more.

![wipe cache partition](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/Bricked-Android-Phone-2.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Finally, on your smartphone, choose the Reboot system immediately.

### Method 3. Perform a Factory Reset

A factory reset can undo the alterations made to your device that resulted in the brick phone, but you will lose everything you have downloaded and installed in the process. Here's how to restore a bricked Android phone to factory settings:

- **Step 1:** Boot your device into recovery mode (turn off your device, then press **power** button + **volume up** button).
- **Step 2:** Select “**Wipe Data/“Factory Reset”** then confirm the action. When the process is done, you'll be returned to the recovery mode menu.
- **Step 3:** Select **“Reboot System Now”** to restart your device.

![reboot system now](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/Bricked-Android-Phone-3.jpg)

### Method 4. Flash a Custom ROM

If you boot your phone directly into recovery mode, there's a problem with the ROM you loaded. Then simply flash the following custom ROM on your phone:

- **Step 1:** Save the required ROM (in ZIP format) to an SD card. The SD card should then be inserted into your Samsung Galaxy S24+.
- **Step 2:** Click the **“Install zip from sdcard”** button. Then, select the ZIP file that contains the ROM. Finally, click the **"reboot system now"** button.

![install zip from sdcard](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/Bricked-Android-Phone-4.jpg)

## Part 3. How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone

How to prevent a device from “bricking” itself and how to repair it if it does The delay is set by the MCU, but it should be long enough to allow the debug adapter to connect to the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device and halt it before the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device disables itself.

- **Being cautious when rooting or jail breaking:**Rooting and Jail breaking disables parts of the operating system's built-in security mechanisms, which are part of what makes the operating system safe, and your data protected from exposure or damage.
- **Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.
- **Backup your phone data regularly:** Backing up your phone safeguards your data in the event that you lose it, it is stolen, or it no longer works. When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.
- **Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:** Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.
