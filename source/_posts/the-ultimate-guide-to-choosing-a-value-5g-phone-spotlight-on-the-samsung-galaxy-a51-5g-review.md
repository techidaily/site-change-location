## Ultimate Showdown: Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Against S21 Ultra Reviewed

 Neither the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra nor the S21 Ultra are the latest models from Samsung, with the[Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review-8548896) beating both. However, both the older phones are still worth considering if you’re looking for a new device. The Ultra range has always been the flagship model of their generation, so both models remain pretty speedy while offering good cameras and excellent screens for all your browsing needs.

 If you’re looking for a slightly older phone, either is still worth it. Also, if you’re wondering whether to upgrade from S21 Ultra to S23 Ultra, the answer is yes. In an ideal world, upgrading from a phone released three years ago to one that's only a year old makes sense. However, the true answer gets more complicated, so it’s helpful to know what both models offer to see if it’s a substantial upgrade for your needs.

### Features: S23 Ultra Remains Powerful With Extra Update Support

 At first glance, the Galaxy S23 Ultra and S21 Ultra look very similar. However, the S23 Ultra is a touch classier thanks to refinements like Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and Armor Aluminum, which means it’s more robust and also feels more expensive.

 Both phones have 6.8-inch displays, but the S23 Ultra sports a wider aspect ratio, so it feels bigger than the narrower S21 Ultra. Such changes also mean that the S23 Ultra weighs a bit more at 8.25 oz instead of 8 oz. You’re already picking a hefty phone, though, so it’s not a significant change.

 The S23 Ultra also has a built-in S-Pen slot; the S21 Ultra lacks that unless you add a case. More importantly, the S23 Ultra comes with an S-Pen. You’ll need to buy the stylus separately if you go for the S21 Ultra.

### S23 Ultra Snapshot: What’s New

 The differences between the Samsung S23 Ultra and S21 Ultra are more incremental than you might expect. Rather than implementing something significantly different, the S23 Ultra is more about refinement. It’s much faster thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor and has a better display.

### S23 Ultra Improvements

* **Adaptive refresh rate** : Rather than a strict 120Hz refresh rate at all times, the S23 Ultra has an adaptive refresh rate that adjusts according to the situation (up to 120Hz).
* **More software updates** : The S23 Ultra, as the newer phone, will continue to be supported until 2028, while the S21’s support will end in 2026.
* **Double the storage on the base model** : The S23 Ultra’s cheapest model has 256GB of storage, compared to the S21 Ultra’s 128 GB.
* **Better battery life** : Both phones have the same battery, but the S23 Ultra will last longer between charges due to a more efficient processor.
* **Dedicated S-Pen slot** : The S23 Ultra is ready to use out of the box, saving you the need to buy a separate S-Pen or a case to fit it.

### Cameras: S23 Ultra Has the Lenses To Rave About

 The S23 Ultra’s camera was the first to offer a 200MP wide lens compared to the S21 Ultra’s 108MP wide lens. It also offers brighter colors than the S21 Ultra, which was known for its relatively muted output. Nighttime photography also looks better on the S23 Ultra with a sharper and more detailed zoom.

 Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.

 The ultra-wide lens is fairly similar in reach, but the S23 Ultra continues to provide more vibrant pictures. Color is a big weakness for the S21 Ultra’s camera setup. For those rare times you wish to take 8K video, the S23 Ultra is much improved, too. Unusually, though, the S23 Ultra has a weaker selfie camera: 12MP compared to the S21 Ultra’s 40MP.

| **Galaxy S23 Ultra Cameras** | **Galaxy S21 Ultra Cameras** |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 200MP Wide                   | 108MP Wide                   |
| 12MP Ultra Wide              | 12MP Ultra Wide              |

### Final Thoughts: Is Newer Better?  

 The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra has a much better camera than the S21 Ultra, providing brighter and more vivid imagery with sharper detail. However, if you love taking selfies, you will miss out on the superior 40MP front camera of the S21 Ultra and be resigned to the S23 Ultra's 12MP front lens.

 Besides the camera, the S23 Ultra is much faster while maintaining better battery life. It also has excellent additions like a dedicated S-Pen slot and a smarter, more expensive-feeling build. Perhaps most importantly, it will also be supported with security updates for longer than the S21, which is starting to show its age on that front. Neither phone is bad, but if you can, pay the extra for the S23 Ultra.
