## Part 1. What is Android Factory Mode?

Factory mode or what is commonly known as factory reset is one of the options available for you when your Itel P55+ is in recovery mode. Several options are available for you once you enter Recovery mode on your device but few are as effective as the wipe data/ factory reset option. This option is useful in solving a whole host of problems that your device could be experiencing.

If you have been using your Itel P55+ for a while now and its performance to be less than ideal, a factory reset might be a good solution. That is however not the only problem a factory reset or factory mode can solve. It will also work for a number or Android errors that you may experience, problems caused by faulty firmware updates and also tweaks made on your device that may not have worked as expected.

It is however important to note that a factory reset or factory mode does often result in the loss of all your data. Therefore a backup is necessary to protect against this data loss risk.

## Part 2. Backup your Android Device First

Before we can see how to safely enter and exit factory mode, it is important to have a full backup of your device. We mentioned that a factory mode will likely erase all the data on your device. A backup will ensure that you can get your phone back to its original state before the factory mode.

In order to do a full and complete backup of your device you need to have a tool that will not only ensure that you backup everything on your device but one that makes it easy for you to accomplish this.

## Part 1: Understanding Bricked Itel P55+

Have you ever heard the term "bricked" concerning your Itel P55+ device? This section explains it to you in simple terms. Imagine your device becoming like a brick, unresponsive and seemingly lifeless. That's what happens when a **Itel P55+ gets bricked**. There are two main types of brick: soft brick and hard brick.

### Soft Brick

Soft brick is like a temporary setback for your device. To see if your **Itel P55+ is soft - bricked**, check out the details below:

- It happens when the software encounters issues, but the hardware is usually fine.

### Common Causes of a Brick Itel P55+

Now, let's discuss why devices end up in this bricked state. It can happen due to a few common reasons:

- **Failed Updates**

Something might go wrong during the process when you're trying to update your Itel P55+ device. This is properly because of a poor internet connection or other interruptions. As a result, your device might get confused and end up bricked.

- **Custom ROM Installations**

A custom ROM is like a customized version of your device's software. While it can bring cool new features, it can also cause issues if not installed correctly. Incompatible or poorly made custom ROMs can sometimes lead to a bricked device.

- **Unauthorized Modifications**

If you're trying to tweak your device's software without proper knowledge, you might make changes that the Itel P55+ device can't handle. This can lead to instability and, you guessed it, a bricked device.

So, why is it important to know all this? Well, a bricked device isn't just frustrating; it can disrupt your daily life. You won't be able to use your device, access your apps, or even make calls. That's why unbricking is crucial.
