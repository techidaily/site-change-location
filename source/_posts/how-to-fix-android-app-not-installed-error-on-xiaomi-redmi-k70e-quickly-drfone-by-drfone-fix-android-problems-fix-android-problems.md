## Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error

You may ask: Why can't I download apps on my Xiaomi Redmi K70E? Understanding the underlying causes of the "Android App Not Installed" error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:

1\. Insufficient storage

Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.

2\. Corrupted/Contaminated App file

When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.

3\. SD Card not mounted in the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device

At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.

4\. Storage location

You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn't installed because of an unknown Error Code.

5\. Corrupt storage

Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn't installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.

6\. Application Permission

Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.

7\. Incorrect file

If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.

The Unknown Error Code during Application installation can occur due to any one or more of the reasons stated above. So read them carefully and understand them well to avoid such glitches in the future.

### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 1: Head to the “Settings” of your Xiaomi Redmi K70E and then opt for “Wireless and Networks” followed by “WLAN/WiFi”.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 3: Depending on your Xiaomi Redmi K70E model, look for “IP Settings” and tap on it. Now, switch the “DHCP” to “Static”.

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.

### Change Network Security Type

It has been observed that, when we connect to Wifi, our device chooses a wrong security type. This clashes with the default security protocol of the router and authentication error occurred due to this. If your device is facing the same issue, then it can be fixed by simply changing its security type. To do this, follow these instructions:

1\. To change the security type of a network, you need to “Add the network”. If you already have the Wifi network saved, then simply forget the network by following the above-mentioned tutorial.

2\. Now, turn on your device’s Wifi and tap on the option of “Add network”. Here, you would be asked to give a network name and select the security type. To manually select it, tap on the “Security” option.

![tap on the “Security”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981521984185.jpg)

3\. From here, you will get a list of various security protocols that you can pick. Select “WPA/WPA2-PSK” and save your selection.

![Select “WPA/WPA2-PSK”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981522445076.jpg)

Now, try to connect to the network again. Most likely, it will let you fix the authentication error on your device.

### Update Android firmware to the latest

There are instances where an outdated OS version of your Xiaomi Redmi K70E may create a hindrance in establishing a connection between your device and the WiFi network. You need to update your Android firmware to the latest version and then check if the problem persists or not.

Step 1: Launch “Settings” of your Xiaomi Redmi K70E and then get into the “About Phone” option.

Step 2: Now, opt for the “System Update” option. If the update is available, get your device updated to the latest OS version.

### Restart the router and reset Android network settings

Sometimes, the WiFi router may hang up while establishing a connection and therefore, the wifi authentication problem occurs. Try restarting your Wi-Fi router and then check if your device connects successfully. If this doesn’t work, try to [reset your Android Network Settings](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html#reset).

### Bonus tip: Turn Airplane mode on/off

By simply turning on the Airplane mode (and later turning it off), you can easily fix the authentication problem Wifi most of the time. You can find a toggle button for Airplane mode on the notification bar of your phone. If you can’t find it there, then go to your phone’s Settings > Connection > More Networks and turn on the feature of “Airplane Mode”.

![go to Connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981523333039.jpg)
