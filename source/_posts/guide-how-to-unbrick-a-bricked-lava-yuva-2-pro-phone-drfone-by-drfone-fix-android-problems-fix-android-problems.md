## Part 1. Common Reasons Why Lava Yuva 2 Pro Phones Get Bricked

A **bricked phone** might sound like a techy term, but it's pretty simple – when your Lava Yuva 2 Pro phone turns into a lifeless block that won't do anything. In this section, you'll learn all about why this happens, so you can avoid these issues and keep your phone alive as long as possible.

![android logo head with broken glass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/how-to-unbrick-a-xiaomi-phone-02.jpg)

- **Trying to flash incompatible ROMs.** Sometimes, people want their Lava Yuva 2 Pro phones to run different software like a custom version of Android called a ROM. But if you use the correct ROM for your specific phone, it can mess things up nicely. Also, inexperience with ROM flashing can **hard brick**your **Lava Yuva 2 Pro** Be sure to follow guides and ask for community help online.
- **Rooting mishaps/failures.**"Rooting" means giving your phone superpowers, but if you mess up, it can go wrong. Your phone might not boot up, leaving you with a brick. Like the previous bullet, follow guides carefully, especially if inexperienced.
- **Failed Firmware Updates.** When your phone asks you to update its software, following the instructions carefully is essential. If you interrupt the process or something goes wrong, your phone could be bricked.

Now, you must know about soft and hard-bricking to learn how to diagnose your phone. [Soft bricking](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-soft-bricked-android.html) is like a phone's bad day – it might not start up. However, with the right help, you can fix it. Hard bricking is worse. It's when your phone is a paperweight – it won't turn on, respond, or do anything useful.

## Why Is My Lava Yuva 2 Pro Offline? Troubleshooting Guide

Ever had your Lava Yuva 2 Pro claim it's offline, leaving you scratching your head about where it went wrong? We get it; it's confusing. That's why this article is here to untangle the mystery.

In the following sections, we're diving into the **"why is My Lava Yuva 2 Pro offline"** dilemma that many Android users face. We'll break down the possible reasons behind this common issue and guide you through simple steps on how to fix it. By the end of the article, you’ll be able to get back to smooth internet surfing on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro. Let’s get started.

## Part 1: Why Does My Lava Yuva 2 Pro Say Offline?

When you encounter the “offline” error message, it can disrupt your usual smartphone activities. Suddenly, you find yourself unable to browse the internet, send or receive emails, or stay connected through instant messages.

It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Lava Yuva 2 Pro showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro. When Airplane Mode is enabled, it disconnects your phone from all wireless networks, rendering it unable to connect to the internet or cellular networks.

2. **Internet connection issues**

Fluctuations in your signal strength or unexpected data loss can also be the culprit behind the **"Why is My Lava Yuva 2 Pro offline?"** problem. Android devices rely on stable internet connections, and disruptions, whether temporary or prolonged, can lead to this error.

3. **Glitches or bugs**

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

4. **Firewall restrictions**

In some cases, a firewall on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro might be overly restrictive, preventing the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device from establishing a connection to the internet. This security measure, intended to protect your device, can sometimes go overboard and disrupt normal online functionality.

Now, you have understood the potential causes as the first step toward resolving the issue. Next, we'll guide you through the process of troubleshooting and getting your Lava Yuva 2 Pro back online.

Here are some easy solutions to get your connection back.

### Solution 1: Change connection to mobile data

## Common Causes of Lava Yuva 2 Pro Screen Unresponsiveness

While Lava Yuva 2 Pro devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Lava Yuva 2 Pro device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Lava Yuva 2 Pro, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Lava Yuva 2 Pro device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Lava Yuva 2 Pro F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Lava Yuva 2 Pro device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Lava Yuva 2 Pro Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Lava Yuva 2 Pro devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Lava Yuva 2 Pro Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent Lava Yuva 2 Pro Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid Lava Yuva 2 Pro Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Lava Yuva 2 Pro App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Lava Yuva 2 Pro Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data.
