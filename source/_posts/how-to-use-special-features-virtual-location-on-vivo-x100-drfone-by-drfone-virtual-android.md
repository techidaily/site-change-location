### Part 1: Circle Route (For Multi-Stop Route)

The circle route feature is under the multi-stop route mode. When your starting point is close to the ending point, a pop-up asks if you want to set up a circle route. Click **Yes** to create a circular path on the map.

### Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)

This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation. If you wish to turn on realistic mode for the one-stop or multi-stop route, look for the respective checkmark option in the panel on the left.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Part 3: Fluctuation Mode (For Teleport Mode)

Whenever you are teleporting your smartphone device to another location, you can try using the fluctuation mode feature offered against it. As you activate **Teleport Mode** from the top-right section and search for a location, you will discover the **Fluctuation Mode** toggle in the confirmation tab. Turn on the toggle to slightly switch the location from the selected point to show realistic motion.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the **Cooldown Timer** on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.

![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to. Find out how you can import and export GPX files with this location-changing application:

Step 1Export the GPX File

If you have defined a proper location to simulate at a particular instant using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can have this location exported by clicking the **Export** icon on the top of the left panel. This will open a window where you can set the location for saving the GPX file.

![export location as a gpx file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png)

## How To Fake GPS On Vivo X100 For Mobile Legends?

People, generally boys, are often found playing games on their cell phones, and they are pretty much addicted to it. Many games are of their interest, but Mobile Legends has always been on the top of the list. Mobile Legends is a game that can be played by a few people simultaneously, and it is called MOBA.

Unlike other games, Mobile Legends allows its players to hide their actual location. Therefore, ML players have many reasons to **fake GPS Mobile Legends,** such as getting a higher rank and playing with their friends wherever they are. Let's find how to fake GPS on ML in this article now!


## **Part 1: Why Do We Need to Fake Location on ML**

Some players want to fake-locate Mobile Legends because it is highly competitive and it usually ranks globally or locally. Most players prefer local street rankings, which are specified according to the area. The GPS detects the location of the Vivo X100 devices in your area while you are in the game. Spoofing your location can bring you new requests and challenges that were practically unavailable in your area.

![alt标签](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/fake-gps-mobile-legends-1.jpg)

The most amazing thing this does to your game is bringing you different teammates from all over the world, which can't be done the other way. Another thing that you can do while using **fake GPS for ML** is to earn a top badge in the less competitive areas. If you want to play the game with your friend, you or he can change the location to play together.

Some countries have very few players of ML. So, if you shift your location to those countries, you have a chance to become the top player. You can also earn a supreme title by using a fake GPS for ML**.** Here’s a list of countries that have a low MMR or power and are considered the best location for fake GPS ML:

- Kuwait
- Mexico
- Romania
- Ukraine
- Qatar
- Peru
- Egypt
- Russia
- Belarus
- Ireland
- Kazakhstan
- Greece
- Vietnamese

## Part 2: How to Change GPS in ML on iOS Devices

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location comes in handy if you're playing Mobile League on an iOS device because it hides your current location. It will also allow you to change your location virtually, allowing you to be in any location without jailbreaking.

It is compatible with all the location-based apps and works seamlessly**,** so you don’t have to worry about the apps glitching. But if you are an Android user, then Dr.Fone doesn't enable fake location on Android games, but it lets you change the location of your Vivo X100.
