### 1\. Outdated Operating System Firmware

One of the primary culprits behind the compatibility error is [<u>outdated OS firmware</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html). App developers release updates to keep up with the latest features and security patches. That's why an obsolete OS version on your device may render it incompatible with the newer app versions available on the Google Play Store.

### 2\. Insufficient Hardware Requirements

Each application has specific hardware prerequisites that your device needs to fulfill. In case your smartphone does not meet the required specifications, you won't be able to utilize the app. Thus, Google Play Store may restrict access to certain applications, citing compatibility issues.

Maintaining your Honor 100's compatibility with the latest app releases is essential. To ensure your Android operating system is up-to-date, please proceed with the following steps:

**Instructions.** You will need to start by accessing the Honor 100 device's “Settings.” Scroll down to find and press the "System" option. On the following screen, tap "Software Update" to check if an update is available. If there is one, follow the on-screen prompts to update your device's OS.

![checking system update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/fixes-for-google-play-device-isnt-compatible-with-version-7.jpg)

### Fix 5: Uninstall the Google Play Store Updates

In certain cases, issues with the [<u>Google Play Store</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) itself may be contributing to compatibility errors. Uninstalling recent updates can revert the app to its default state. It can potentially resolve the problem. Follow these steps to uninstall updates for the Google Play Store and resolve “**device not compatible Play Store”** issues:

- **Step 1.** Using your Honor 100's Settings, access the Google Play Store app in the "Apps" tab. Once on its info page, tap the three dots icon from the top right corner.

![navigate app settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/fixes-for-google-play-device-isnt-compatible-with-version-8.jpg)

![uninstall play store updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/fixes-for-google-play-device-isnt-compatible-with-version-9.jpg)

### Fix 6: Sideload the Incompatible Android App

If all else fails and the compatibility issue persists, sideloading the app can be a workaround. It means installing the app manually without using the Google Play Store. This approach proves especially valuable for users with a strong determination to access a specific application. Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial on how to sideload an app:

### Fix 7: Install a Custom ROM

Have you exhausted other options and are still grappling with compatibility issues? Installing a custom ROM could be a more advanced but effective solution. Custom ROMs are modified versions of Android operating systems developed by the Android community. Engaging in this procedure entails large modifications to your device's software. It is crucial to comprehend the potential consequences and proceed with caution.

Installing a custom ROM may void your device's warranty. Moreover, it's crucial to choose a ROM compatible with your device model. Installing a custom ROM is an advanced solution that should be approached with caution. It has the capability to address compatibility issues. Nevertheless, it demands a certain level of technical expertise and may not be suitable for all users.

### Fix 8: Try Using a Third-Party App Store

The final solution to avoid compatibility issues on the Google Play Store is to use a different app store. Exploring alternative app stores can be a pragmatic workaround. Several third-party app stores offer a diverse range of applications. They might provide the desired app without encountering compatibility errors and help avoid the "**device not compatible Google Play”** error.

You can explore reputable third-party app stores such as Aptoide, Amazon Appstore, GetJar, or SlideME. Ensure the chosen app store is reputable and widely used, minimizing potential security risks. Exercise caution and ensure the legitimacy of the app store to avoid security risks.
