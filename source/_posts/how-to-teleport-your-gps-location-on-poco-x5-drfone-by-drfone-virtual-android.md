## How To Teleport Your GPS Location On Poco X5?

While playing games like Pokemon Go, you are in desperate need of finding more Pokémon. If so, changing your location is a necessity that needs to be figured out. For that, teleporting the GPS location of the Poco X5 device is the optimal solution. To carry this out, Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) provides a perfect system for fake locations.

**Note:** Once you teleport or move to a virtual place, you can restore to the actual location by restarting the Poco X5 device. You will see a prompt that reminds you to restart your device to restore the location of the connected device when you close the Virtual Location. Click **Restart Device** and close the program.

![restart device on closing virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/restart-decive.png)

_\* Dr.Fone Mac version still has the old interface, but it does not affect the use of Dr.Fone function, we will update it as soon as possible._

The Teleport Mode offered in Virtual Location is a great way to change the location of iOS/Android devices. If you wish to show a different location to someone else, the best way is to use this mode on Virtual Location. This can be done by following the steps described below:

Step 1Activate Teleport Mode

Once you have connected your smartphone, continue to select the **Teleport Mode** option from the top-right section. The particular icon is represented by the first icon from the left in that section.

![select teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Step 2Add Location To Teleport

After activating **Teleport Mode,** click the search bar on the top-left to type in the location where you want to shift. After adding the location, hit **Enter** to proceed.

![look for a location to teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Note:** If you can't find your current location when searching spots on the map, you can click the **Current Virtual Location** icon on the right sidebar to show your current virtual location.

Step 3Confirm the Location For Teleporting

You will be directed to the particular, and the map will display it for confirmation. If you are willing to teleport to this specific location, click **Move Here**.

![confirm the location to spoof](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

Step 4Location Successfully Changed On Computer

The location of the smartphone will be instantly changed to the selected location and will be displayed on the map.

![move location successfully](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png)

Step 5Location Changed On the Smartphone

Open your smartphone and access its maps application. Look into the current location of the Poco X5 device and verify it to be the same as the changed location on the computer.

![confirm location on the smartphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png)

### Part 2: Instantaneous Movement Between Multiple Points (Jump Teleport Mode)

Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also allows the movement of the smartphone device between multiple places with the Jump Teleport Mode. If you want to make your **location spoofing** look realistic, the steps below will be beneficial:

Step 1Activate Jump Teleport Mode

You will have to first access the **Jump Teleport Mode** option from the second icon from the left in the top-right section. This can be done after teleporting the location of the smartphone device.

![turn on jump teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/jump-teleport-mode.png)

Step 2Set Spots to Jump Teleport

Continue to select the spots you want to pass one by one on the map by simply tapping on them with your mouse. After selecting multiple spots, click the **Start Moving** button at the bottom of the left panel to start the movement.

![define points for jump teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/choose-jump-teleport-destination.png)

Step 3Change Location Between Set Spots

As prescribed, you can propagate amongst the set spots with the Jump Teleport Mode. Use the **Next Point** and **Last Point** buttons to shift your location.

## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Poco X5

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try

If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:

1. **Route4Me**

Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices. The app has integrated AI technology that would let you generate optimum routes based on different parameters.

Users can simply search for any location and generate its optimum route from a selected spot.

There are more than 2 million generated routes by its existing users that you can explore.

The GPX file generator would let you save the route for offline viewing or exporting to another app.

You can generate up to 10 routes for free and can get its premium version to generate more routes.

_Runs on_: iOS and Android

Price: Free or $9.99

2. **Routes: GPX KML Generator**

If you are looking for a more advanced GPX generator app for your Android, then you can try Routes. The app will let you generate and export/import routes on your phone for free and that too in the preferred terrain of your choice.

5. **GPX Viewer: Tracks, Routes, and Waypoints**

## Part 3: How to View GPX Files Offline on your PC?

As you can see, with the help of a GPX file generator, you can easily save your routes offline.

I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the best route generator app to meet your requirements. I have listed Pokemon map generator as well as running route generator apps that you can consider. Once you have got a GPX generator, you can also use a tool like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to import/export GPX files and can also use it to play Pokemon Go remotely with its location spoofing feature.



## Will iSpoofer update On Poco X5

iSpoofer has been one of the most in-demand applications for changing your location while playing Pokemon Go. For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.

![ispoofer shut down pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg)

All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.

## Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?

![ispoofer not able to log in pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg)

To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.

![Ispoofer error message pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg)

Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.

Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.

![Ispoofer account suspension pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg)

The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far

Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.

## Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?

There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.

**VPNs -** There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.

![VPNs-pic-5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg)

Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.

![Google-play-store-apps-pic-6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg)

The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -

**Step 1 -** You can use the [Dr.Fone Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html)Spoofer for both Android and iPhones. So, starting off, you need to connect your Poco X5 (the phone) to your system - be it a laptop or a computer. You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.

![drfone-change-location-pic-7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg)

**Step 2 -** Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned. You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page. Enter your new location on the map.

![Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8.jpg)

**Step 3 -** You can use the coordinates to get to the location or once the map displays, you can zoom in and move the pointer from one place to another and then click on ‘Move Here’ so that the location will be shifted from the previous one to new.

![Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9.jpg)

**Step 4 -** Now it’s easier to launch Pokemon Go but give it a few minutes before your changed location is completely registered and keep the new location realistic.

As in, you can’t jump from Russia to America in 2 hours, can you?

![change-location-registered-pic-10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-registered-pic-10.jpg)

It’s quite easy to spoof your location for games like Pokemon Go using Dr. Fone and it will even stay undetected if you do it the right way. Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works. While you wait for the iSpoofer update (which may or may not come) you can use this in the meantime.
