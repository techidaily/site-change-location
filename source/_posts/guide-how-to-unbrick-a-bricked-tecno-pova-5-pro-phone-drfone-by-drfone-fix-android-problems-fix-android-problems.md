Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Tecno Pova 5 Pro device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Tecno Pova 5 Pro, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Tecno Pova 5 Pro device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Tecno Pova 5 Pro F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Tecno Pova 5 Pro device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Tecno Pova 5 Pro Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Tecno Pova 5 Pro devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Tecno Pova 5 Pro Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

## What Causes A Tecno Pova 5 Pro Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Tecno Pova 5 Pro phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Tecno Pova 5 Pro screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Tecno Pova 5 Pro Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Tecno Pova 5 Pro screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Tecno Pova 5 Pro model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Tecno Pova 5 Pro Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Tecno Pova 5 Pro black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Tecno Pova 5 Pro's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Tecno Pova 5 Pro device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Tecno Pova 5 Prologo appears.

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

Another solution is to back up the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built.
