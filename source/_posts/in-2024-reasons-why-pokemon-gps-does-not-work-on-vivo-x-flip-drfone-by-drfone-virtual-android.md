### 4\. Alolan Muk

## Where to Catch the best Pokemon for Ultra League?

Now, Pokemon Go Ultra League has a CP limitation when it comes to picking your Pokemon. CP limits players to select from a wide range of Pokemon list and also have the chance to avoid the most robust set of Pokemon in the battle.

With such a limit, everyone can be innovative and experimental on which Pokemon deserved to battle.
