Clearing cache is a good idea because it cleans your device and reduces the burden on the Android software and gives it enough space to function normally and carry out its operations.

In case the Android system crash issue is temporary, follow the steps given below to clear your device’s cache:

1\. On your Oppo A38, visit “Settings” and find “Storage”

However, if the Android crash problem is such that your phone has frozen, becomes unresponsive, and does not turn on, you must first boot into the Recovery Mode screen.

1\. Press the volume down button and power button together until you see a screen with multiple options before you.

![boot in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988992495864.jpg)

3\. After the process is completed, select “Reboot System” which is the first option in the recovery mode screen.

## Part 8: Remove the SD card to fix the Android crash issue

Removing and formatting your SD Card to fix the Android System crash issue is helpful when a corrupted SD Card disturbs the Android software forcing it to shut down suddenly.

To format your SD Card, just follow the instructions below.

1\. Firstly, eject it from the Oppo A38 device.

2\. Then using an SD Card reading tool, insert the Card in your PC. Open Computer and then right-click on the SD card to format it.

![format sd card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/format-sd-card.jpg)

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Oppo A38 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Oppo A38 device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Oppo A38 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Oppo A38 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Oppo A38 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Oppo A38 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Oppo A38 is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Oppo A38 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Oppo A38s.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Oppo A38 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Oppo A38 device. So if your Oppo A38 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Oppo A38 device’s animation type and speed on your Oppo A38 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Oppo A38 to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Oppo A38 is running slow and freezing, the Oppo A38 device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues

Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Oppo A38 device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Oppo A38 is running slow and freezing.

### Your Internet Connection is Unstable

Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too. Most apps today rely heavily on the internet to execute some tasks like communicating and streaming. So don’t panic when your Oppo A38 is running slow and freezing. It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.
