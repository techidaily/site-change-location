### Method 1: Ensure app and system updates

Updates often include patches for known issues and vulnerabilities. Ensuring that both apps and the system are up to date can resolve many potential problems.

Step 1: Visit the Google Play Store to check for available app updates.

Step 2: In "Settings," go to "System" > "Software Update" to check for system updates.

### Method 2: Reset app preferences

App preference settings might sometimes lead to conflicts or anomalies. Resetting these settings can revert apps to their default state, resolving potential issues.

Step 1: Go to "Settings" on your device.

Step 2: Access "Apps."

Step 3: Tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner and select "Reset App Preferences."

### Method 3: Clear the cache and data on your device

Step 1: Go to Settings> Applications> Manage Applications and find the Google Services framework.

Step 2: Next, find Google Play from the same Manage Applications page.

Step 3: Tap on it and then Tap on clear cache.

![clear crash](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-process-media-02.jpg)

Step 4: Press the back button to go back to the Google Services framework and then choose Force stop > clear cache > OK

Step 5: Next you need to open Google Play and when presented with an error, click OK

Step 6: Turn off the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G device and then turn it back on. Go to the Google Services framework again and turn it on to see if the issue has been resolved.

### Method 4: Check Google Sync & Media Storage settings

Step 1: Go to Settings > Accounts and Personal> Google Sync and uncheck all the checkboxes to stop the Google Synchronization.

Step 2: Disable and Clear all Media Storage data by going to Settings> Apps> All Apps. Find the Media Storage> Clear Data> Disable

Step 3: Use the same method as above to clear the Download Manager data

Step 4: Turn off your device and then turn it on

This Should clear the error message for good.

### Method 5: Boot your device into safe mode

[Safe mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html) can temporarily disable third-party apps, allowing only core system apps. This detects if a third-party app causes the "Android process media keeps stopping" error. If the problem disappears in safe mode, a third-party app might be the cause. Uninstalling it can restore normal function. If the problem persists in safe mode, a deeper system issue might exist, needing further investigation or support.

## **What causes a Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**
