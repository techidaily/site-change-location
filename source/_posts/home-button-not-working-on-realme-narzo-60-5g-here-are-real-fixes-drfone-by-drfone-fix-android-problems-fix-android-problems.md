## Common Causes of Realme Narzo 60 5G Screen Unresponsiveness

While Realme Narzo 60 5G devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Realme Narzo 60 5G device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Realme Narzo 60 5G, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Realme Narzo 60 5G device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Realme Narzo 60 5G F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Realme Narzo 60 5G device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Realme Narzo 60 5G Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Realme Narzo 60 5G device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Realme Narzo 60 5G device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Realme Narzo 60 5G devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Realme Narzo 60 5G Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent Realme Narzo 60 5G Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Realme Narzo 60 5G device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Realme Narzo 60 5G device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Realme Narzo 60 5G App Store.

## How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working on Realme Narzo 60 5G

You probably touch the screen of your phone hundreds of times per day. It’s no surprise that smartphone touchscreens are one of the most common components to fail, given their delicate glass construction. However, a ****part of the touch screen not working**** on your Realme Narzo 60 5G does not necessarily mean it is a hardware issue. There could be other reasons why your Android’s touch screen stopped responding.

If your phone’s touchscreen frequently fails to respond, there are several things you can try before calling a professional. This article will reveal those proven fixes you can easily perform independently.

## Part 1. Why Is Part of My Screen Not Working

There are two possible causes as to why your phone’s touch screen is not working. One is the touch screen may have been damaged, and the other is the Realme Narzo 60 5G device may be experiencing technical difficulties.

If you drop your phone and it becomes stuck against something, the touch screen’s connectivity may fail. Only a part of the touch screen may sometimes become damaged and unresponsive. That may also occur when there is a technical failure, such as the phone hanging. A ****part of the touch screen not working**** can occur when malware is downloaded or when phone settings are changed.

- Nexus touch screen not working
- LG screen is unresponsive to touch

## Part 3. How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working (No Physical Damage)

If you have already tried running the Realme Narzo 60 5G device in diagnostic mode and verified that it is not physically damaged, then the problem is most likely technical. If your Realme Narzo 60 5G’s screen is not responding to touches for technical reasons, follow the methods below to resolve the issue.

### Restart Your Device

When your touch screen stops working, the first thing you should do is restart your device. The operation is known as soft resetting. You cannot turn your device off from the option on the screen because the touch screen is not responding. Here are the steps to take.

****Step 1:**** Hold the “Power” button until the Realme Narzo 60 5G device turns off.

**Tip:** If you hold down the power button for a few seconds, you will see the “Power Off” and “Restart” options on the screen. You can’t use it because the entire screen isn’t responding. Hence, you should press and hold the “Power” button for as long as necessary.
