### Method 5. Uninstall unnecessary apps

As we mentioned above, due to a lot of apps being installed at the same time, the issue can crop up. And hence, if the above solution didn’t help, you can try to uninstall the apps that you don’t need currently. We hope this works. But if not, you can go to the next fix.

### Method 6. Clear Google Play Services cache

If still you cannot update Google Play Services, clearing cache can solve your problem. We also stated this in the beginning as the reason. If you don’t know, cache holds the app’s data temporarily so that it can remember the information when you next open the app. Many times, old cache files get corrupted. And clearing cache can also help in saving storage space on your device. For these reasons, you need to clear cache of Google Play Services to get rid of the problem.

Here is how to clear Google Play Services cache:

![set correct date and time](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/clear-cache.jpg)

- Launch “Settings” on your phone and go to “Apps & Notifications” or “Application” or “Application Manager”.
- Now, from all the apps’ list, choose “Google Play Services”.
- On opening it, tap “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.

### Method 7. Boot into download mode to clear cache of whole phone

If unfortunately, things are still the same, we would like to recommend you wipe the cache of the whole device to fix the issue. This is an advanced method to solve issues and is helpful when the ZTE Blade A73 5G device is facing any flaws or malfunctions. For this, you need to go to the download mode or recovery mode of your device. Every device has its own steps for this. Like in some, you need to simultaneously press the “Power” and “Volume Down” keys. While in some, the “Power” and both “Volume” keys work.

This is how it works when Google Play Services can't be installed on your device:

![google play services not installing - wipe cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/wipe-data.jpg)

- Turn off the ZTE Blade A73 5G device to begin with and then follow the steps for recovery mode.
- On the recovery screen, use the “Volume” buttons for scrolling up and down and go to “Wipe cache partition”.
- To confirm, press the “Power” button. Now, the ZTE Blade A73 5G device will begin to wipe the cache.
- Hit reboot when asked and the ZTE Blade A73 5G device will now be rebooted finishing the issue.

### Method 8. Check your Android storage

Generally speaking, Google Play Services can update automatically in the background. But if there is not enough storage on your Android, the automatic update may fail, so check your android space.

### Method 9. battery optimization

Some devices aggressively optimize battery usage, which can interfere with the background processes required for updating Google Play Services. Disable battery optimization for Google Play Services in the ZTE Blade A73 5G device's Settings to ensure uninterrupted updates.

### Method 10. Check date and time settings

Sometimes, incorrect date and time settings on your device can cause conflicts with Google Play Services updates. Ensure that your device's date and time are set correctly and set to automatic. Follow the steps below to set the date and time on your android correctly.

![set correct date and time](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/date-and-time.jpg)

- Open "Settings" and go to "General Management".
- Click "Date & time" and then enable "Automatic date & time". Or you can disable and re-enable it.

### Method 11. Factory Reset your Android

This method will wipe away all your data while performing and make the ZTE Blade A73 5G device go to factory state. Please ensure to keep backing up your important data if you are going to take the help of this method.

### Fix 8: Factory reset Android

It is always considered the most used way to factory reset your phone in order to resolve the process system not responding error. Though, this should be your last resort, as it will wipe off your device’s data entirely. Even if you are performing a factory reset, make sure that you back up your data by using a reliable tool like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/).

### Fix 9: Unroot the ZTE Blade A73 5G device

It has been further discovered that the process system isn’t responding error is more common in rooted devices. Therefore, if you also have a rooted Android device, then you can choose to unroot it in order to fix this issue. There are different ways to unroot an Android device. One of the easiest ways to do it is by using the SuperSU app.

You can always download either SuperSU or SuperSU Pro app from its website [here](https://supersuroot.org/). Simply install it on our device and launch it whenever you wish to unroot it. Visit its “Settings” tab and select the option of “Full unroot”.

![full unroot](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671048148.jpg)

This will generate a warning message regarding all the repercussions of the unrooting process. Just tap on “Continue” to initiate the process.

![continue unroot](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671247132.jpg)

If you are using an older version of Android, then you might get another pop-up to restore boot images. Simply make the desired selection and start the process. After a while, your device would be restarted the usual way, and it would be unrooted. Most probably, this will resolve the process system isn’t responding error as well.
