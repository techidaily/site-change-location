## Part 1. What Are the Possible Leagues in Pokémon GO PvP

There are three core leagues in the trainer battles in Pokémon GO, namely Great, Ultra, and Master. Each of these leagues has its own CP limitation and comes in rotation during each season.

**Step 3:** After all the previous steps, the next step is to click on the “teleport mode” icon, which will be located in the upper-right part. This will activate the teleport mode. After that, you have to enter the name of the location or place where you wish to teleport to in the upper left field. Finally, tap on “Go”. As an example, we are going to enter “Italy”, Rome in the left field.
