## What Causes A Lava Blaze Pro 5G Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Lava Blaze Pro 5G phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Lava Blaze Pro 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Lava Blaze Pro 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Lava Blaze Pro 5G screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Lava Blaze Pro 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Lava Blaze Pro 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Lava Blaze Pro 5G Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Lava Blaze Pro 5G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Lava Blaze Pro 5G black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Lava Blaze Pro 5G's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Lava Blaze Pro 5G device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Lava Blaze Pro 5Glogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

If restarting the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Lava Blaze Pro 5G Y2 and Lava Blaze Pro 5G 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

You can clear your cached data using the default settings.

- Select **Settings**\> **Storage** > **Cached Data**.

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device, so it should only be considered a last resort.

In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Lava Blaze Pro 5G Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.
