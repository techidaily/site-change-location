## 9 Quick Fixes to Unfortunately TouchWiz has stopped Of Xiaomi Redmi A2+

“Unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped” is the talk of the town due to annoying TouchWiz UI, a front-end user interface developed by Xiaomi Redmi A2+. Not to mention, the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ has borne a whole lot of heat from its agitated users over the years and the reason is pretty much obvious due to the pre-installed bloatware apps and the theme launch “TouchWiz home”. That not just brutally annoys users and eats up a heck of internal storage space but lags up too often due to low speed and stability. As a result users end up with “Unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped” and “Unfortunately, TouchWiz has stopped”. Apparently, there are several flaws in the design and functioning of this launcher and hence, Touchwiz keeps stopping or becomes unresponsive.

Here in this section, we will introduce some scenarios that can be blamed for why **_TouchWiz is not working_**. Check out the following points:

- More often than not, the **_TouchWiz keeps stopping_** **<u>after an Android update. </u>** When we update our Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device, the old data and cache usually conflicts with TouchWIz thereby cropping up this mess.
- When you **<u>disable some built-in apps</u>**, you might get in trouble with TouchWiz. Doing this sometimes can hamper the TouchWiz operation and raise the “**_unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped_**” error message.
- Many times **<u>installing some third-party apps and widgets</u>** can cause this problem. The apps like launchers can be conflicting with TouchWiz home launcher and therefore cease it to work. Also, a glitched widget is responsible for the same i.e. forces stop the TouchWiz.

### Reset Factory settings

If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.

Along with this, we would also suggest you go take backup of your data so that you won’t lose any of the personal information from your device after performing factory reset. For your convenience, we have stated the backup steps too in the following guide. Have a look:

- Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup & Reset”.

- Now, scroll for “Factory Data reset” option and confirm it by clicking “Reset Phone”.

### Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz

We believe that you will find the above methods helpful. However, if still in case your **_TouchWiz is not working_**, we advice you that you should install a new theme launcher in your device. It will be a wise option to ditch TouchWiz in such scenario rather than tolerating the problem. Hope this advice will help you.
