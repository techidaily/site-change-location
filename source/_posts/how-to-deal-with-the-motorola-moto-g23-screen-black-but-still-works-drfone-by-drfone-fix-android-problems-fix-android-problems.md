### App Troubles

If your **phone is working, but the screen is black,** there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application. An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.

### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software. This problem suggests that your Motorola Moto G23 is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately. If this is the cause, then your device is likely experiencing a critical system error, and you should directly try to reboot your phone.

### Hardware Problem

If you dropped your phone, there’s a high chance the LCD connectors went loose due to the physical impact. If this happened to you, the phone might be working, but the screen is black due to the LCD cable dislodging. Another issue could be your phone got exposed to extreme temperatures. This can also cause a **black screen but your phone is still on.**

## **What causes a Motorola Moto G23 Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Motorola Moto G23 phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Motorola Moto G23 device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Motorola Moto G23 smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Motorola Moto G23 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **There might be issues with the Motorola Moto G23 device itself**

Screens on Motorola Moto G23 devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every Motorola Moto G23 device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **There might be errors in the updated software**

The phone won't power on or become stuck in a boot loop where the logo will only show intermittently. For example, some Motorola Moto G23 4 and 5 users have reported their screens are unresponsive after a software update, rendering the Motorola Moto G23 device unusable.

## **The common solutions to solve a Motorola Moto G23 Screen unresponsive**

Before taking the item in for repairs, see if you can figure out the problem independently. Do you want to learn the method? If the touch screens on your Motorola Moto G23 stop working, don’t panic; we'll teach you exactly what to do.

## Motorola Moto G23 Screen Unresponsive? Here's How to Fix It

Motorola Moto G23 phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Motorola Moto G23 touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Motorola Moto G23 phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Motorola Moto G23 touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Motorola Moto G23 Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Motorola Moto G23 phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Motorola Moto G23 screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Motorola Moto G23 Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Motorola Moto G23 device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Motorola Moto G23 screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Motorola Moto G23 model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Motorola Moto G23 Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.
