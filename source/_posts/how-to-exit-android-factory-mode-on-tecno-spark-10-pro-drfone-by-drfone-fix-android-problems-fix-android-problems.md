## How to Exit Android Factory Mode On Tecno Spark 10 Pro?

You’ve often heard that recovery mode will solve just about any problem your Tecno Spark 10 Pro is experiencing. This is mostly true and one of the components of Android’s recovery mode, factory mode or [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/wipe-data-factory-reset.html) is one of the most efficient ways to solve various problems on your device. While factory mode is often a good thing, there are times when your device can enter factory mode on its own. Other times, you can safely enter factory mode but not know how to get out.

Fortunately for you, this article will explain all aspects of factory mode and especially how to safely exit factory mode.

## Part 1. What is Android Factory Mode?

### 3.9 Factory reset to fix Android black screen of death

The factory reset is the option that enables the factory state of your device by erasing all data, settings, bugs, and apps. Your device will be fresh like factory condition after this reset. Worth mentioning here, you’ll lose all the internal data and installed apps after this reset. So, to overcome the Android tablet black screen of death, you must perform this action as the last option. Follow the below steps carefully.

Step 1: Turn off the Tecno Spark 10 Pro device. Then press the Volume Up + Power button + home button (or press Volume Up + Power buttonS) altogether and let the mobile boot into recovery mode.

Step 2: After booting up in recovery mode, you can find the "Factory data reset" option. Navigate to that option with the volume up and down arrow and select it with the power button.
