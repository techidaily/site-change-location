Step 6: Turn off the Tecno Spark 10C device and then turn it back on. Go to the Google Services framework again and turn it on to see if the issue has been resolved.

### Method 4: Check Google Sync & Media Storage settings

This detects if a third-party app causes the "Android process media keeps stopping" error. If the problem disappears in safe mode, a third-party app might be the cause.

## Common Causes of Tecno Spark 10C Screen Unresponsiveness

While Tecno Spark 10C devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Tecno Spark 10C device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Tecno Spark 10C, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Tecno Spark 10C device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Tecno Spark 10C F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Tecno Spark 10C device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Tecno Spark 10C Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Tecno Spark 10C device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Tecno Spark 10C device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Tecno Spark 10C devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## Part 2: How to Fix Your Bricked Android Phone

Android devices are usually very flexible in allowing users to flash ROM but sometimes an incorrect process can result in a bricked device. While there are few solutions to this problem, here are a few things you can do;

### When the Tecno Spark 10C device Boots Straight into Recovery

If the Tecno Spark 10C device can boot to the recovery screen, you can find an alternative ROM to install and copy it your device. Installation can then be done in the recovery menu. If the Tecno Spark 10C device is booting to recovery mode there is a chance that it can be fixed.

Step 1: Load up Clockworkmod or any other recovery tool that you have been using.

Step 2: Once you are in, navigate to the “Reboot system now.” If you are using Clockworkmod, this should be your first option. Hopefully everything will work just right if you do this, If it doesn’t you may need to download and re-flash the ROM again.

## Part 3: Useful Tips to avoid Bricking your Android Phone

1. Ensure that you are familiar with the Fastboot or ADB commands before doing anything. You should know how to recover your device by flashing a command line and also manually transfer important files to your device.
2. Make a backup of your device. This is obvious but most people fail to adhere to it. At the very least you can get back all your files and settings to transfer to a new phone.
3. Keep a full Nandroid backup on your phone
4. Keep another backup on your PC which you can access should anything go wrong with the Custom ROM installation
