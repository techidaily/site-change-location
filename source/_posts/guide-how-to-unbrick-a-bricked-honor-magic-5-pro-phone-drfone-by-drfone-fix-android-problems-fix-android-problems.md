## Part 1. Common Reasons Why Honor Magic 5 Pro Phones Get Bricked

A **bricked phone** might sound like a techy term, but it's pretty simple – when your Honor Magic 5 Pro phone turns into a lifeless block that won't do anything. In this section, you'll learn all about why this happens, so you can avoid these issues and keep your phone alive as long as possible.

- **Trying to flash incompatible ROMs.** Sometimes, people want their Honor Magic 5 Pro phones to run different software like a custom version of Android called a ROM. But if you use the correct ROM for your specific phone, it can mess things up nicely. Also, inexperience with ROM flashing can **hard brick**your **Honor Magic 5 Pro** Be sure to follow guides and ask for community help online.
- **Rooting mishaps/failures.**"Rooting" means giving your phone superpowers, but if you mess up, it can go wrong. Your phone might not boot up, leaving you with a brick. Like the previous bullet, follow guides carefully, especially if inexperienced.
- **Failed Firmware Updates.** When your phone asks you to update its software, following the instructions carefully is essential. If you interrupt the process or something goes wrong, your phone could be bricked.

Now, you must know about soft and hard-bricking to learn how to diagnose your phone. [Soft bricking](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-soft-bricked-android.html) is like a phone's bad day – it might not start up. However, with the right help, you can fix it.

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.

### 2.1 Open the Phone app in Safe Mode

First and foremost, the thing that can let you get rid of this trouble is Safe Mode. It is a feature that will end any excessive background functioning of the Honor Magic 5 Pro device. For instance, your device will be able to run sans any third-party apps when in Safe mode. Since the important functions and the naïve apps will be running on the Honor Magic 5 Pro device, you will get to know if it’s really a software glitch or not by running the Phone app in Safe mode. And this is the first solution we would recommend you make use of when the Phone app has stopped. Here is how to enable Safe Mode.

1. Switch off the Honor Magic 5 Pro phone first.
2. Now keep pressing the "Power" button until you see the Honor Magic 5 Pro logo on the screen.
3. Release the button and immediately press and hold the "Volume Down" key.
4. Leave the key once the Honor Magic 5 Pro device is in Safe mode. Now, the third-party apps will be disabled and you can check if the Phone app is still not responding or everything is fine.

### 2.2 Clear the cache of the Phone app

The cache should be cleaned timely if you want any app to work properly. Due to the constant usage, the temporary files get collected and may corrupt if not cleared. Hence, the next solution you should try when the Phone app keeps stopping is to clear the cache. Here are the steps to be performed.

1. Open "Settings" on your device and go to "Application" or "Apps".
2. Now from the list of all applications, go to "Phone" and tap on it.
3. Now, click on "Storage" and choose "Clear Cache".

![Phone app crashing - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-phone.jpg)

### 2.3 Update Google Play services

Since Android is created by Google, there must be some Google Play services that are crucial to run several system functions. And if attempting the previous methods isn’t of any use, try updating Google Play services when you find the Phone app stopped. For doing this, you need to make sure that automatic updates are turned on in Google settings. If not, enable it and get the apps including Google Play services updated for smoother functions.

### 2.4 Update the Honor Magic 5 Pro firmware
