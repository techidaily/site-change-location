You need a Special Trade whenever you wish to trade a legendary Pokemon or a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go.

To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It'll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.
