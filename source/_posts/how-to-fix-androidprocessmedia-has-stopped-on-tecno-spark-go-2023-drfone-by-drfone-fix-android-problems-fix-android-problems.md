### 2.2 Clear cache and data of Contacts app

The cache memory basically stashes the copies of the concerned application. It is indeed a streak of copies of the desired app storing information and incurring additional space on the storage.

1. First of all, go to “Settings” application from the app drawer or from the notification panel.
2. Now, surf and select for “Applications” or “Apps & notifications”.
3. Here, you need to browse for “Contacts” app and open it.
4. On “Contacts” app, just tap on “CLEAR CACHE” and “CLEAR DATA” button. This will prompt the cache memory to be cleared.

### 2.3 Wipe cache partition

As we know the cache memories are the temporary files build by the firmware. These are of little importance as they are bound to become a bit more corrupted in nature. And sometimes, may indirectly become a hurdle for the working of contacts app. It is good if the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device is cleared off from the caches. Instead of manually wiping down the cache memory, we will understand how to clear off the cache partition in the following steps.

1. From device, just power off your device. Then, press the “Volume Down + Power” button with “Home” combinations together.
2. In a moment’s time, lose fingers from the “Power” button but do not release fingers from “Volume Down” and “Home” buttons.
3. Once you view the “Android System Recovery” screen, just lose the “Volume Down” and “Home” buttons.
4. Over the options available, just opt for “wipe cache partition” by tapping the “Volume down” button until the desired option is highlighted.
5. Finally, push the “Power” key to give consent to the selection.

![contacts app stopping - wipe cache partition](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/wipe-cache-partion.jpg)

7. After, the process is through there will be an option for “Reboot System Now”. Tap on it and restart the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device.

### 2.4 Disable Google+ app

The root cause for detecting any problem is not very easy. You never know the overloading of Google + application might have directly impacted contacts app crashes. To resolve it, disabling it may prove to be a helpful solution. Here is the quick reference for disabling Google+ application.

1. First of all, visit “Settings” from your Tecno Spark Go (2023).
2. In “Settings”, visit the “Application Manager” or “Applications” menu and browse for “Google +” app.
3. From the application main page, you can choose to do either of the methods:

- Either, completely disable the application to work by pressing on “Force stop” or “Disable” feature.
- Or, brush away the unnecessary cache piled up on your storage by using “Clear Cache” functionality.

There will be a prompt stating that the application may misbehave. However, you must disable the feature and check whether it worked out for you or not.
