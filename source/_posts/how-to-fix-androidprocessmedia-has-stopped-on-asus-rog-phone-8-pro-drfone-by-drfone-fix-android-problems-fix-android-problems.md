### 1. Changes to the Software

Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the ****Android boot screen****.

Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.

Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an ****Android phone stuck on the logo**** page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.

### 2. Android Software Updates

Updates are a common cause of ****Android phones stuck on the logo****. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen**** and many others might occur.

Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.

When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your ****Android phone getting stuck on the logo****.

### 3. Malfunctioning Applications

If you noticed that your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.

This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro functioning properly.

If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted.

## 8 Workable Fixes to the SIM not provisioned MM#2 Error on Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro

SIM cards are small chips that act as a connecting medium between your cell phone and your carrier. It is programmed to help your carrier identify your cell phone account with certain information. And eventually, you are enabled to make calls and to make use of mobile internet. Now, if your device is showing “SIM not provisioned” on Android then it signifies that the connection to carrier network cannot be established or perhaps, your carrier isn’t able to identify your cell phone account.


## Part 1. Why does the error “SIM not provisioned MM#2” pop up?

There can be numerous reasons behind the pop up that reads “SIM not provisioned” on Android. But basically, it most probably affects the users who have registered a new SIM card. If you get to experience this issue in other situations or if the SIM is not working in Android, then the problem is with the SIM card and needs to be replaced. Anyways, here is a list of situations when the “SIM not provisioned” error may bother you.

- You got a new SIM card for your new phone.
- You are transferring your contacts into the new SIM card.
- In case, the carrier network provider’s authorization server is unavailable.
- Perhaps, you’re out of the reach of the carrier coverage area and that too, without active roaming agreement.
- Though new SIM cards work flawlessly. But it is often necessary to get your SIM card activated due to security reasons.

Just in case, you haven’t bought any new SIM card and the one you were using was working fine until now, then the most probable reasons behind it could be listed below:

- If your SIM card is too old, possibly it might have gone dead, try replacing it.
- Perhaps, the SIM card was not properly inserted into the slot or there might be some dirt between the SIM and smartphone pins.

A yet another reason could be that your SIM card got deactivated by your carrier provider as it could have been locked to a particular phone. Now, if you insert such a SIM card to another device or a new device even, you may get to witness a message that reads “SIM not valid”.

At times, the issue can be as simple as cleaning your SIM card and SIM slot properly. Ensuring that SIM is not wet either and then putting it back into its place.

- Turn your device back on and look if your SIM not provisioned on the Android issue is resolved or not.

### 2.4 Activate the SIM card

Usually, when you buy a new SIM card, it gets automatically activated within 24 hours of being plugged into a new device. But if that’s not happening in your case and you’re wondering how to activate SIM card, make use of the three options below to enable activation:
