Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch.

Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.

### 2\. **Turn off Your Tecno Spark 10 Pro’s Airplane Mode**

### 4\. Take use of a Burner Phone

Burner phones make it very easy to disable location tracking on Life360. In addition, disposing of a burner phone keeps your personal information private and secure.

- Install Life360 on the burner phone, and then login in using the same account you used on your primary device.
- Establish a connection between your phone and the free Wi-Fi that is accessible.
- If you delete this application from your smartphone, your parents will no longer be able to monitor your phone use.
