## How to Exit Android Factory Mode On Xiaomi Mix Fold 3?

You’ve often heard that recovery mode will solve just about any problem your Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 is experiencing. This is mostly true and one of the components of Android’s recovery mode, factory mode or [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/wipe-data-factory-reset.html) is one of the most efficient ways to solve various problems on your device. While factory mode is often a good thing, there are times when your device can enter factory mode on its own. Other times, you can safely enter factory mode but not know how to get out.

Fortunately for you, this article will explain all aspects of factory mode and especially how to safely exit factory mode.

## Part 1. What is Android Factory Mode?

Factory mode or what is commonly known as factory reset is one of the options available for you when your Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 is in recovery mode. Several options are available for you once you enter Recovery mode on your device but few are as effective as the wipe data/ factory reset option. This option is useful in solving a whole host of problems that your device could be experiencing.

If you have been using your Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 for a while now and its performance to be less than ideal, a factory reset might be a good solution. That is however not the only problem a factory reset or factory mode can solve. It will also work for a number or Android errors that you may experience, problems caused by faulty firmware updates and also tweaks made on your device that may not have worked as expected.

It is however important to note that a factory reset or factory mode does often result in the loss of all your data. Therefore a backup is necessary to protect against this data loss risk.
