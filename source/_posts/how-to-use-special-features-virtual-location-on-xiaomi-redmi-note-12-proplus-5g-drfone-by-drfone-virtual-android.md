### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the **Cooldown Timer** on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.

![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to. Find out how you can import and export GPX files with this location-changing application:

Step 1Export the GPX File

If you have defined a proper location to simulate at a particular instant using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can have this location exported by clicking the **Export** icon on the top of the left panel. This will open a window where you can set the location for saving the GPX file.

## How to Simulate GPS Movement in AR games On Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G?

With technological advancements, there have been noticeable upgrades in different types of software, including online games. For example, developers are incorporating Augmented Reality technology into their gaming systems, aiming to offer a dynamic user experience to gamers. This works in different manners, but one of the most common is the GPS-based movement syncing ability, as you may have seen in Pokémon Go.

However, this has some limitations, like some people needing the opportunity to roam to different areas realistically to catch in-game rewards. Plus, accidents can also occur if one follows the game and reaches an unsafe location. In these cases, using a verified **fake GPS route APK** is useful, but there are important rules to take note of. Let's discuss this.

## Part 1. Why Would You Simulate GPS Movement on AR games?

In AR games that come with GPS tracking software, they track the real motion of users. Before jumping into discussing the methods of **Pokémon Go spoofing Reddit** or other forums include, it is useful to understand why simulating GPS movement is necessary.

- The GPS-based motion-tracking feature in AR games does not track real-time traffic conditions, so safety concerns are there in the matter of traveling to spots.
- Some players can't travel in the first place for various reasons like financial constraints, health concerns, and current location.

In these cases, using a **fake GPS route** helps simulate the location of players, so they can still take part without actually moving around.
