Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Xiaomi 13 Ultra, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the "Backup & Restore" option on the screen.

To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.

Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup & Restore from the menu list.

Step 2: Press "Restore" to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created

Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.
