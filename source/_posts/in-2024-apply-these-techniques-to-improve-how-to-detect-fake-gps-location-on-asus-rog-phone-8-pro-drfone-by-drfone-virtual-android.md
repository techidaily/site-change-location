However, if you're going to spoof your location when playing games, getting more dating matches, or accessing geo-locked content, then you're going to need a more dedicated program for that.

Trying a GPS spoofing app like [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) lets you do more without taking a single step outside. You can also travel without worries when you're out if you want to fool your friends with your exact location.
