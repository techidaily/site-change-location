We understand that it can be a tricky situation to be in when Android App not installed error pops up, but what if we tell you can get rid of it in easy and simple steps? Yes, there is!

### #1. Delete unnecessary files/Apps

Insufficient storage can prevent the app from being installed. Make some storage space on your device by cleaning unwanted data and deleting extra media and other files. You can also get rid of heavy Apps by:

Visiting “Settings” on your device. Then select "Manage apps", "Application Manager" or "Apps" (varies based on device model or version) from the list of options before you.

![application manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994440695192.jpg "application manager")

Now select the App you wish to uninstall and wait for the App Info screen to open, then click on “Uninstall” as shown in the screenshot.

![uninstall app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994441067237.jpg "uninstall app")

![uninstall app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/android-app-not-installed-1.jpg "uninstall app")

### #2. Use only Google Play Store

As you are all aware, the Play Store is specially designed for Android software and contains only trusted and safe Apps. It is often known as the “Android Market” because it is loaded with different types of Apps to stiffly all your needs so that you don't have to rely on other third-party sources to purchase/install Apps.

![play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994442154924.jpg "play store")

### #3. Mount your SD Card

Another remedy for Android App not installed error is to make sure that the SD card inserted in your device is not inaccessible.

![mount sd card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/android-app-not-installed.jpg "mount sd card")

To check the same:

First, disconnect your Vivo Y100i Power 5G from your PC and then visit “Settings” on your Android and select “Storage” from the options that appear. Finally, click on “Mount SD Card” at the Storage Info screen.

You can now restart your device and try to install the app now, it should work!

### #4. Choose App location wisely

It is advisable to not tamper with the App’s location and let the software decide where it needs to be placed. As far as possible, let the Apps be in your device’s internal memory.

### #5. Format SD Card

The chances of your SD Card being corrupted are very high. You can format it either while it is in your device or externally.

Now to Clean up your SD Card, simply visit “Settings” and select “Storage” and tap on “Format SD Card” and mount it once again to use it smoothly.

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue.

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.
