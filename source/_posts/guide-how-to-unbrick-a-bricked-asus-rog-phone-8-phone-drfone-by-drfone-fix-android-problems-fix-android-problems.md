## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Asus ROG Phone 8 device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Asus ROG Phone 8 device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Asus ROG Phone 8 freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.

### Common Reasons for Your Asus ROG Phone 8 Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Asus ROG Phone 8 devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Asus ROG Phone 8 device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.
