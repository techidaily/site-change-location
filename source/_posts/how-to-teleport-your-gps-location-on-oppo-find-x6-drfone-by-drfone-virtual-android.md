**_Option #1:_** Check if the software is updated to the latest software. You can check if you need an update by going to the menu for the “check for upgrade” button. Once it says that an update is available, do update the software as the update could contain some fixes for some issues in the software from its previous versions.

**_Option #2:_** Make sure your iOS phone is also updated to the latest version. Double-check if your phone needs updating in the phone settings and update it as needed. If the phone is not updated, it can also hinder some features of the software.

**_Option #3:_** Ensure that your location sharing is enabled on your phone. Despite sharing a spoof location, you will still need to enable your location sharing so the software can track wherever you currently are. You can do this by going to your phone's setting and going to “location” to enable sharing.

**_Option #4:_** Restart your phone or computer. If you have exhausted all the tips we shared, you can try this basic troubleshooting to fix this issue. Usually, just a quick restart on your phone or computer can help to make your Foneazy MockGo work again.

Try all of these tricks that we have shared and get that temporary issue in Foneazy MockGo fixed in no time.
