## What Causes A Honor X7b Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Honor X7b phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Honor X7b screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Honor X7b Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Honor X7b device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Honor X7b screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Honor X7b model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Honor X7b Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Honor X7b Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Honor X7b screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Honor X7b model.

### 1. Restart The Device

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Honor X7b black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Honor X7b's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Honor X7b device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Honor X7b device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Honor X7blogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Honor X7b device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Honor X7b device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Honor X7b device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Honor X7b device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Honor X7b device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Honor X7b Y2 and Honor X7b 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Honor X7b device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

You can clear your cached data using the default settings.

- Select **Settings**\> **Storage** > **Cached Data**.
- To clear the cache, select **Clear Cache**.

![clear cached data on xiaomi 5a](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/clear-cached-data-on-xiaomi5a.png)

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Honor X7b device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Honor X7b device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Honor X7b device, so it should only be considered a last resort.

In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Honor X7b Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.

- Open the **Settings**.
- Navigate to the A**dditional settings** section of the Honor X7b Redmi 5A settings.
- Please scroll down the screen until you reach the **Backup & reset** option, then click to access it.
- Click**Erase all data (factory reset)** to restore the network settings and applications, or completely reset the Honor X7b Redmi 5A.

## Part 2: What will it affect to uninstall Google Play Service?

If you think that Google Play Service only provides a platform to download new apps, then you are wrong. It provides several other functions that might alter the way you use your smartphone. It is linked with other essential Google services as well, like Google Maps, Gmail, Google Music, etc. After uninstalling the Google Play Service, you might face trouble using various essential apps.

Furthermore, it might tamper with the overall functionality of your device as well. For instance, you could encounter network issues, messaging problems, app crashing, and more. Since the Play Service is closely associated with Android system, it might have a prominent effect on your phone. If you have a rooted device, then you can easily install custom ROM and resolve these issues. Though, for a non-rooted device, overcoming these problems could be a big hurdle.
