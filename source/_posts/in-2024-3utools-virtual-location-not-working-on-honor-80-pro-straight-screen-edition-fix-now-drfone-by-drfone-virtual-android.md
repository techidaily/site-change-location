### 1\. Solving the internet issues

Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.

If this is the cause of your **3uTools virtual location not working**, there isn't much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to "Mapbox" to see if it addresses the problem.

### 2\. Restarting and Closing the Software

When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. 3uTools reinstallation

The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.

### 4\. Restarting Your Computer

Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.

### 6\. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded

Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components.

As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.

### Key Features of Fake GPS Location Pro

To know more about this location spoofing application, it is necessary for you to go across the features of the tool. This will help you learn more about the technicalities involved in location spoofing on Android devices:

**1\. Different Map Types**

There is not a single form of display of maps available on this application. You can observe the map in the "Normal" display, followed by a "Terrain," "Satellite," and "Hybrid" display. The variety of map display types gives you the leverage of observing the location deeply. You can ensure that the location you're shifting your device to is appropriate and tangible in all conditions.

**2\. History**

Anything location that has been searched and changed is saved in the "History" section of this application. **Fake GPS Location Pro** keeps a catalog of the history of locations that you have spoofed. This gives you better accessibility in situations where you have to change the location again.

**3\. Set Favorites**

You can set different locations as "Favorites" to give you better access to locations when you are looking forward to spoofing your device's location. This tool offers you the option of saving more time and effort in changing location every time.

**4\. Joystick and Movement**

Unlike other location spoofing tools, **Fake GPS Pro APK** provides the option of a virtual joystick for moving around the location with ease. You can witness fake movements on the map using the joystick and simulate movements with the help of designated spots on the map.

## Part 3: User Reviews for Fake GPS Location Pro

Are you still confused about the performance of this location spoofer app? We have provided some user reviews below to help you out:

| Reviewer | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Bobby Nichols | "I was using a different app for quite some time. However, if My Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition sit untouched for an hour..... YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!" |
| Brian Thompson. | "Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren't available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you'd charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user." |
| Gerald | "It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text. If you send the link via Google maps the recipient has to press the play store link to see your location. What if they are not using an android phone? Also very sluggish." |
