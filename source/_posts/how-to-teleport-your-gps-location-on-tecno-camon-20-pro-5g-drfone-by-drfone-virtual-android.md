## Part 3: User Reviews for Fake GPS Location Pro

Are you still confused about the performance of this location spoofer app? We have provided some user reviews below to help you out:

| Reviewer | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Bobby Nichols | "I was using a different app for quite some time. However, if My Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G sit untouched for an hour..... YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!" |
| Brian Thompson. | "Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren't available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you'd charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user." |
| Gerald | "It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text. If you send the link via Google maps the recipient has to press the play store link to see your location. What if they are not using an android phone? Also very sluggish." |

If you are searching for an alternative app to the iToolab AnyGo, look no further and check out the [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It is similar to other GPS spoofing apps but promises a smooth, natural, and realistic simulation of any GPS location.

Games are always fun playing with joysticks. And if you play games like Pokemon GO with it, you will experience better and seamless control over your Pokemon character in the simulation.

The app has a low detection rate which prevents you from jailbreaking and avoids getting your account banned. The developers are always alert and constantly updating the app, so you get the most benefit from Dr. Fone Virtual Location. In addition, it is highly compatible with devices running the latest version, so you do not have to worry if the app will work on your device if you are running iOS 17 or Android 12 or later versions.

One great feature that Dr. Fone Virtual Location consists of is sharing your fake location with your family. So you can play pranks with them and have a great time. You can also connect with new friends and get to know their whereabouts.
