### Check Network Connection

As already mentioned, be sure of an active internet connection while working with Gmail. When you are not using a stable connection, it may lead to stuck on sending, Gmail crashing and many other issues. You can fix the issue by doing these three things:

1. Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.
2. Turn off Wi-Fi and then turn it on again after nearly 5 seconds. Do the same with the router. Plug it out and the plug in.
3. Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.

Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.

### Check Attachments

Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending.

### Reason 2. Battery Optimization and Refreshment

**Solution:** Sometimes, a power cycle helps [optimize the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device's battery performance](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-your-phone-battery-health.html) and refreshes the system. Allow the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G 3/4 to completely power down, charge it for at least 30 minutes, then attempt to turn it on.

### Reason 3. Software Hang-Up or Temporary Glitch

**Solution.** To shut down your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G 3/4, press and hold the power button, then choose 'Power Off' from the menu that appears. After the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device powers down, wait for about 30 seconds to 1 minute to ensure it has fully shut down before moving forward.

### Reason 2. Factory Reset as a Solution

[Performing a factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html) serves as the ultimate solution. This is true when facing critical software damage that leads to a non-responsive Samsung Galaxy A23 5G 3/4.

#### Steps To Perform a Factory Reset on Samsung Galaxy A23 5G 3/4

- **Step 1.** Access the "Settings" application on your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G 3/4. Then, navigate through the menu until you locate the "System" category located further down the list. Within the "System" settings, tap the last option named "Reset Options."

## Scenario 7. Phone Hangs on Installed App

There are scenarios where a phone, like the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G 3, hangs or gets stuck on a specific installed app. It happens during the startup process, and it can prevent the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device from turning on properly. This issue often arises due to a malfunctioning or poorly coded app. This app disrupts the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device's startup routine, causing **Samsung Galaxy A23 5G 4 won’t turn on**.

### Reason 1. Third-Party Apps Interference

**Solution:** Start by booting the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G 3 into Safe Mode. This mode disables third-party apps, allowing you to access the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device without interference from downloaded applications.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Reason 2. Problematic App

**Solution:** While in Safe Mode, observe if the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device boots up properly. If it successfully boots, it suggests that a third-party application is causing the problem. To pinpoint the problematic app, uninstall recently added apps individually and restart the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device after each removal. This process helps pinpoint the problematic app causing the hang during startup.

### Reason 3. Stacked Up App Cache and Data

**Solution:** If the problematic app is identified, try clearing its cache and data. Go to Settings and then access "Apps." Within "Apps," find the Problematic App and tap "Storage & cache." On the subsequent display, select "[Clear cache](https://drfone.wondershare.com/erase-android/clear-cache-android.html)" and "Clear storage" to restore the application to its original settings. After restarting the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device, verify whether the problem persists.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Reason 4. Outdated Application

**Solution:** If the application is essential, ensure to seek updates within the Google Play Store. Updating the app to its latest version could potentially resolve any compatibility issues. Alternatively, if updates are not available or don’t resolve the problem, consider uninstalling and reinstalling the app.
