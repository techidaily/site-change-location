### [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

iOS system does not contain GPS location spoofing settings, and Apple does not allow GPS spoofer apps in the App Store. Anything you can find in the App Store is not authentic or reliable.
