You may ask: Why can't I download apps on my Samsung Galaxy S23 FE? Understanding the underlying causes of the "Android App Not Installed" error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:

1\. Insufficient storage

2\. Corrupted/Contaminated App file

When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.

3\. SD Card not mounted in the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device

At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.

4\. Storage location

You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn't installed because of an unknown Error Code.

5\. Corrupt storage

Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn't installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.

6\. Application Permission

Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.

7\. Incorrect file

Booting your Samsung Galaxy S23 FE into Safe Mode is a useful troubleshooting step to fix boot loop issues caused by third-party apps. When in Safe Mode, the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device will start up with only essential system apps, and any downloaded apps that might be causing conflicts won't run. Here's how you can boot your Samsung Galaxy S23 FE into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:

**Step 1: Power Off Your Device**

Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.

**Step 2: Access Safe Mode**

To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:

- For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer's logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device finishes booting. You should see "Safe Mode" displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.
- Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device's user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.

**Step 3: Observe the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device**

Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn't occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.

**Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps**

Now that you're in Safe Mode, it's time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.

**Step 5: Restart Normally**

Once you've identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.

By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Samsung Galaxy S23 FE.

## Problem 5: Stuck in sending

Now, here is another annoying problem that doesn’t let Gmail working on Android properly. This problem addresses the situation where users send a mail but it gets stuck on sending. If this is the problem that you are going through, the following solutions will help you.

### Try Alternative Gmail Address

### Check Network Connection

1. Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.
2. Turn off Wi-Fi and then turn it on again after nearly 5 seconds. Do the same with the router. Plug it out and the plug in.
3. Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.

Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.
