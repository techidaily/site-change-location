### Method 3: Reboot the Vivo V29 Pro device

This might seems weird but this trick has been working to quiet some time now and has been proven to eliminate the failed location 12 Pokémon Go issue.

Just long-press the power button and choose the reboot option from the menu that appears to complete the process in full.
