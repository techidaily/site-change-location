## Part 1. Common Reasons Why Motorola Moto G34 5G Phones Get Bricked

A **bricked phone** might sound like a techy term, but it's pretty simple – when your Motorola Moto G34 5G phone turns into a lifeless block that won't do anything. In this section, you'll learn all about why this happens, so you can avoid these issues and keep your phone alive as long as possible.

![android logo head with broken glass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/how-to-unbrick-a-xiaomi-phone-02.jpg)

- **Trying to flash incompatible ROMs.** Sometimes, people want their Motorola Moto G34 5G phones to run different software like a custom version of Android called a ROM. But if you use the correct ROM for your specific phone, it can mess things up nicely. Also, inexperience with ROM flashing can **hard brick**your **Motorola Moto G34 5G** Be sure to follow guides and ask for community help online.
- **Rooting mishaps/failures.**"Rooting" means giving your phone superpowers, but if you mess up, it can go wrong. Your phone might not boot up, leaving you with a brick. Like the previous bullet, follow guides carefully, especially if inexperienced.
- **Failed Firmware Updates.** When your phone asks you to update its software, following the instructions carefully is essential. If you interrupt the process or something goes wrong, your phone could be bricked.

Now, you must know about soft and hard-bricking to learn how to diagnose your phone. [Soft bricking](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-soft-bricked-android.html) is like a phone's bad day – it might not start up. However, with the right help, you can fix it. Hard bricking is worse. It's when your phone is a paperweight – it won't turn on, respond, or do anything useful.

If your device is not functioning or locked, then you can perform the factory reset operation by putting your phone into Recovery mode. Most of the time, it can be done by pressing the Power and Volume up button simultaneously for at least 10 seconds. Though, the key combinations might change from one device to another.

![factory reset phone in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980670718056.jpg)

After entering the Recovery mode, go to the “wipe data/factory reset” option using the Volume up and down button. Use the Power button to make a selection. If you get an additional message, then select the “yes – delete all data” option. When it is done, you can simply reboot your device.
