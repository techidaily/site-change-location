It can certainly help you get started. How do I share my location on Messenger without physically being there? That’s simple. Use Messenger or Google Maps’s pinned location. Furthermore, download [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) on your computer. Its Virtual Location feature, capable of modifying your location settings, can provide protection for your privacy. Just connect your Xiaomi Redmi K70 to the computer and set it up from there.
