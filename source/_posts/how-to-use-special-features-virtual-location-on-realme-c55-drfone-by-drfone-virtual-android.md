### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the **Cooldown Timer** on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to.

Step 1Export the GPX File

If you have defined a proper location to simulate at a particular instant using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can have this location exported by clicking the **Export** icon on the top of the left panel. This will open a window where you can set the location for saving the GPX file.

## How to Fix Realme C55 Find My Friends No Location Found?

[![avatar](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

In this time of modern technology, it is hard to be away from your phone or even leave it at home. When any task that we plan to do, usually already have an application released for the sole purpose of doing that task and needing to do it on your phone. When we message our friends, have a video call with our family, or just simply order food to eat at home, you can do all of them on the Realme C55 device in your palm.

Another advantage of having our phones with us all the time is that you can also see the current location of either your friend or family. For Apple phone users, they have an app that is called "Find My Friends" that will show you the locations of the people that you are tracking. But what if you cannot find the location of the friend? We will find out the causes as to why no location can be found and how you can fix this in just a few simple steps.

## Part 1: Why does an Realme C55 say "no location found"?

When you are searching for your friend's current location and it shows that "no location found", there could be numerous reasons as to why that is happening. We have listed down the possible reasons why there is no location found.

## Fixing Foneazy MockGo Not Working On Realme C55

Foneazy MockGo is one of the most popular software out there that allows you to share a temporary, fake, or spoof location with others. There are different factors as to why you will use this software, such as a tool for your games that require your geographic location or some. On the other hand, it could just be for your own security. Whatever your reason is, you can use this software to share a fake location with anyone.

Similar to other software, you will for sure encounter some problems or limitations when using Foneazy MockGo.

Therefore, we will share with you in this article some tips that you can use to fix some issues that you will encounter and what alternatives you can use in case you cannot fix the issue in Foneazy MockGo.

## Part 1: What is Foneazy MockGo?

Foneazy MockGo is a popular location spoofer tool that is used by users to use in their location-based AR games, or for some, using it with applications that require your location, such as Tinder. So that way, you are able to check what other locations in the world have in their area than being limited to the area that you are in.

Aside from giving you a temporary location, it also stimulates real-time movement, which is very important for players who use it for their games. Within just a few clicks, you can teleport yourself to any place in the world without having to need to book a flight. Aside from that, you can ensure the safety of your real location if you use this software.

May that be cycling, driving, or walking, you can choose the speed you want to simulate a real-life journey without having to do any steps yourself. They also have a beginner user-friendly interface that will not confuse first-time users

On another note, we will share with you the limitation of the Foneazy MockGo software. Currently, this application is only available for iOS phone users, and Android users. Therefore, you are not able to use this software. Another limitation is that it does not support macOS versions that are older than 10.10. Reaching out to their customer support can also take a long time as they take time to respond to you. Lastly, the software will stop updating, and you will need to check yourself if the software needs to be updated.

## Part 2: How to Fix Foneazy MockGo Not Working Issue

Being able to share a spoof location or use it in games is fun and a great way to fool any of your friends. However, while using the Foneazy MockGo software, you will encounter instances where it is not working properly. Therefore, we will share with you some quick fixes and checks that you can do on your own to fix the temporary issue within the software.

**_Option #1:_** Check if the software is updated to the latest software. You can check if you need an update by going to the menu for the “check for upgrade” button. Once it says that an update is available, do update the software as the update could contain some fixes for some issues in the software from its previous versions.

**_Option #2:_** Make sure your iOS phone is also updated to the latest version. Double-check if your phone needs updating in the phone settings and update it as needed. If the phone is not updated, it can also hinder some features of the software.

**_Option #3:_** Ensure that your location sharing is enabled on your phone. Despite sharing a spoof location, you will still need to enable your location sharing so the software can track wherever you currently are. You can do this by going to your phone's setting and going to “location” to enable sharing.

**_Option #4:_** Restart your phone or computer. If you have exhausted all the tips we shared, you can try this basic troubleshooting to fix this issue. Usually, just a quick restart on your phone or computer can help to make your Foneazy MockGo work again.
