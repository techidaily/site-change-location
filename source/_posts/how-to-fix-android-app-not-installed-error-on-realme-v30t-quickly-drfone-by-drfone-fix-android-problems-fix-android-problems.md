2\. Corrupted/Contaminated App file

When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.

3\. SD Card not mounted in the Realme V30T device

In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.

Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.

## **What causes a Realme V30T Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Realme V30T phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Realme V30T device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Realme V30T smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Realme V30T 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.
