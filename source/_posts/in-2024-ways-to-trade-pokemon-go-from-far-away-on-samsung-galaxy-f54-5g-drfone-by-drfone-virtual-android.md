## Part 2: Which pokemon can you evolve with trading?

Evolution is one of the most important aspects of the game Pokemon go. You can evolve several pokemons just by trading them. There are several pokemon that you can evolve using trading. Given below is the list of the different pokemon that can benefit from evolution.

- Kadabra
- Machoke
- Graveler
- Haunter
- Boldore
- Gurdurr
- Karrablast
- Shelmet

However, trading Pokemons in Pokemon go could be slightly tricky without having at least one close friend in the games who is also of a considerable level. Only then, you will be able to evolve your pokemon by trading.

## Part 3: How to do the special trade?

You need a Special Trade whenever you wish to trade a legendary Pokemon or a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go. These pokemon are very rare to find and hence you won’t want to trade these rare Pokemons very often, however, you can trade a rare Pokemon only once per day. To trade a rare Pokemon would also need to be a Great or Best friend, two of the highest levels of friendship in the game Pokemon go. To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It'll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.

## Final Words

Trading in Pokemon go was introduced in recent times and had now become one of the most integral factors of the game. Pokemon go trading has changed the gaming trend. However, you could get an upper hand by using a virtual location changer such as [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) . This can help you to even trade pokemons seamlessly with friends staying at far-off places. Using the pokemon trade feature and evolving pokemons is a smart and handy way to progress further in the game. As a Pokemon go player, you must try it out!

Save time and energy by using Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location feature. There is no need to physically travel to different places by simply adjusting your virtual location.

When coupled with powerful Pokémon GO Plus +, it can increase your chances of encountering Sleeping Snorlax significantly. Here is how to enhance your gaming experience and get help in capturing **Pokémon sleeping Snorlax** via Dr.Fone - Virtual Location:

- **Step 1.** **Activate Teleport Mode in Dr.Fone - Virtual Location**

Open Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, connect your smartphone with an original USB cable, and choose the "Teleport Mode" option located in the top-right section. The specific icon for Teleport Mode is the first one from the left in that section. Once Teleport Mode is activated, click on the search bar at the top-left to input the desired location. After entering the location, press "Enter" to continue.

- **Step 2.** **Teleport to the Chosen Location**

As you enter the desired location, the map will confirm your selection. If you wish to teleport to this designated location, click on "Move Here." The smartphone's location will promptly switch to the chosen destination and reflect on the map. You can then verify that the Samsung Galaxy F54 5G device's current location matches the updated location by opening the maps app on the Samsung Galaxy F54 5G device.

- **Step 3.** **Simulate Movement with One-Stop Route**

To simulate movement, navigate to the top-right section and click “One-Stop Route.” It is the third icon from the left. After moving to the desired location, tap anywhere on the map to designate your destination. Specify the number of round trips and opt for either a Round or Loop trip. Adjust the walking speed by sliding the speed option. Finally, tap "Move Here" for the movement simulation.

- **Step 4.** **Enable the Multi-Stop Route Feature**

If you want to visit more than one stop, enable the Multi-Stop Route mode. You can do it by accessing the top-right section adjacent to the One-Stop Route mode. Once activated, designate multiple locations on the map by selecting your desired points. Specify the number of trips and speed settings. Initiate the process by clicking on "Start Moving." During the simulation, you can "Pause" the sequence at any point.
