## Part 1: Why Did My Oppo Reno 11F 5G Screen Go Black but Still Works? Common Causes

Experiencing a **cell phone blank screen** is not exclusive to Android or iOS users. A **phone screen not turning on** happens all the time due to several factors that may or may not be out of your control. While they can be frustrating, here are some common causes you should know as to why **your phone screen went black but still works.**

### A Drained Battery

The first thing that comes to mind when your **phone screen suddenly goes black** is you have a drained battery. Even though this is obvious, it’s still important to mention, as this is usually what most people encounter. To fix this problem, plug your smartphone into a charger and wait for your device to turn on again. If it works, then you just prevented a rather annoying experience.

### App Troubles

If your **phone is working, but the screen is black,** there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application. An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software. This problem suggests that your Oppo Reno 11F 5G is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately. If this is the cause, then your device is likely experiencing a critical system error, and you should directly try to reboot your phone.

### Hardware Problem

If you dropped your phone, there’s a high chance the LCD connectors went loose due to the physical impact. If this happened to you, the phone might be working, but the screen is black due to the LCD cable dislodging. Another issue could be your phone got exposed to extreme temperatures. This can also cause a **black screen but your phone is still on.**

## 9 Quick Fixes to Unfortunately TouchWiz has stopped Of Oppo Reno 11F 5G

“Unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped” is the talk of the town due to annoying TouchWiz UI, a front-end user interface developed by Oppo Reno 11F 5G. Not to mention, the Oppo Reno 11F 5G has borne a whole lot of heat from its agitated users over the years and the reason is pretty much obvious due to the pre-installed bloatware apps and the theme launch “TouchWiz home”. That not just brutally annoys users and eats up a heck of internal storage space but lags up too often due to low speed and stability. As a result users end up with “Unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped” and “Unfortunately, TouchWiz has stopped”. Apparently, there are several flaws in the design and functioning of this launcher and hence, Touchwiz keeps stopping or becomes unresponsive.

Here in this section, we will introduce some scenarios that can be blamed for why **_TouchWiz is not working_**. Check out the following points:

- More often than not, the **_TouchWiz keeps stopping_** **<u>after an Android update. </u>** When we update our Oppo Reno 11F 5G device, the old data and cache usually conflicts with TouchWIz thereby cropping up this mess.
- When you **<u>disable some built-in apps</u>**, you might get in trouble with TouchWiz. Doing this sometimes can hamper the TouchWiz operation and raise the “**_unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped_**” error message.
- Many times **<u>installing some third-party apps and widgets</u>** can cause this problem. The apps like launchers can be conflicting with TouchWiz home launcher and therefore cease it to work. Also, a glitched widget is responsible for the same i.e. forces stop the TouchWiz.

- Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup & Reset”.

### Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz

We believe that you will find the above methods helpful. However, if still in case your **_TouchWiz is not working_**, we advice you that you should install a new theme launcher in your device. It will be a wise option to ditch TouchWiz in such scenario rather than tolerating the problem. Hope this advice will help you.
