### Method 1: Invest in a Burner Phone

**Step 1.** Your existing log-in information will work just as well when installing Life360 on your backup phone.

**Step 2.** When you arrive at your destination, connect your burner phone to the Wi-Fi network.

**Step 3.** Don't use Life360 anymore on your phone.

![ invest in a burner phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-your-location-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Disable Wi-Fi and Cellular Data Access

Turning down the Nokia 105 Classic device's potential to interact with Wi-Fi and cellular networks is another option for generating a false location.

**Step 1.** To prevent applications from renewing themselves in the background, you must use the option that saves battery life.

**Step 3.** Navigate to the settings menu, look for the Life360 option, and then off cellular data, background refresh, and the Motion & Fitness feature.

## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Nokia 105 Classic

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.
