An array of VPN apps come with built-in location spoofing features on top of the usual IP address masking. For example,

### 1\. Nord VPN

NordVPN includes additional features to stay ahead of Hulu’s VPN blocks. It has a Smart DNS tool, to unblock streaming apps on games consoles and Smart TVs, and a functional app for Amazon Fire TV, too, though, it isn’t quite as fast as ExpressVPN, but it’s more than fast enough for HD streaming.

**Pros**

- Affordable price tag
- Useful Smart DNS feature
- IP and DNS leak protection

**Cons**

- Only one Japan server location
- Unable to pay by PayPal

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. ExpressVPN

- In-built DNS and IPv6 leak protection
- Smart DNS tool
- 14 US cities and 3 Janpanese location severs

**Cons**

No matter what VPNs you are using, the steps are basically as same as the following:

- Open a VPN app on your phone.
- Choose a country IP address that you hope to change to.
- Switch the button to make a connection on VPN.
- Refresh or reopen your Google Map, and then input your desired location on its search section.
- It's complished when the desired location is found.
