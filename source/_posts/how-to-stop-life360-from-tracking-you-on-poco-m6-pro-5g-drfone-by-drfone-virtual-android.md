![wondershare drfone virtual location module](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4:** Click Get Started. NEW Feature: Poco M6 Pro 5G users are now able to go wireless after setting this up the first time!

The screen shows your real location – as per the actual GPS coordinates of your device.

![drfone virtual location interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

That's it! You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here's how:

**Teleporting To Another Location**

**Step 1:** Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode

**Step 2:** Start typing your destination location and click Go

![drfone virtual location teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3:** You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Poco M6 Pro 5G.

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Poco M6 Pro 5G app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family.

This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

### [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

iOS system does not contain GPS location spoofing settings, and Apple does not allow GPS spoofer apps in the App Store. Anything you can find in the App Store is not authentic or reliable. There are two viable solutions to [changing iPhone GPS](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-gps-location-ios.html) on the market:

- Using a computer application.
- Turn to VPN service.

A GPS-focused computer application can spoof your location to almost any chosen place in the world and mimic your movement along a predetermined route. On the other hand, a VPN is solely focused on IP addresses, which means it uses a different IP address to change your location.

Dr.Fone software supports both iOS and Android, a one-stop solution to change the location on your phone. There is no need to be concerned about compatibility difficulties as it works flawlessly with location-based apps such as Pokemon Go, Snapchat, Life 360, etc. With it, the location cannot limit enjoyment anymore. Not only can you enjoy AR-based games, but you can also change the GPS coordinates of all the social media apps you are using, such as Instagram and Facebook. Also, the list includes dating apps like Tinder and Grinder.
