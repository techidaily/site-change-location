- **Step 2.** **Teleport to the Chosen Location**

As you enter the desired location, the map will confirm your selection. If you wish to teleport to this designated location, click on "Move Here." The smartphone's location will promptly switch to the chosen destination and reflect on the map. You can then verify that the Vivo S17t device's current location matches the updated location by opening the maps app on the Vivo S17t device.

- **Step 4.** **Enable the Multi-Stop Route Feature**

If you want to visit more than one stop, enable the Multi-Stop Route mode. You can do it by accessing the top-right section adjacent to the One-Stop Route mode. Once activated, designate multiple locations on the map by selecting your desired points. Specify the number of trips and speed settings. Initiate the process by clicking on "Start Moving." During the simulation, you can "Pause" the sequence at any point.
