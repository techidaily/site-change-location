## How to Simulate GPS Movement in AR games On Vivo T2 Pro 5G?

With technological advancements, there have been noticeable upgrades in different types of software, including online games. For example, developers are incorporating Augmented Reality technology into their gaming systems, aiming to offer a dynamic user experience to gamers. This works in different manners, but one of the most common is the GPS-based movement syncing ability, as you may have seen in Pokémon Go.

However, this has some limitations, like some people needing the opportunity to roam to different areas realistically to catch in-game rewards. Plus, accidents can also occur if one follows the game and reaches an unsafe location. In these cases, using a verified **fake GPS route APK** is useful, but there are important rules to take note of. Let's discuss this.

## Part 1. Why Would You Simulate GPS Movement on AR games?

In AR games that come with GPS tracking software, they track the real motion of users. Before jumping into discussing the methods of **Pokémon Go spoofing Reddit** or other forums include, it is useful to understand why simulating GPS movement is necessary.

- Some players can't travel in the first place for various reasons like financial constraints, health concerns, and current location.

In these cases, using a **fake GPS route** helps simulate the location of players, so they can still take part without actually moving around.
