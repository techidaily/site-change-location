The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.

**Step 3:** After all the previous steps, the next step is to click on the “teleport mode” icon, which will be located in the upper-right part. This will activate the teleport mode. After that, you have to enter the name of the location or place where you wish to teleport to in the upper left field. Finally, tap on “Go”. As an example, we are going to enter “Italy”, Rome in the left field.
