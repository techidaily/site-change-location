## What Causes A Infinix GT 10 Pro Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Infinix GT 10 Pro phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Infinix GT 10 Pro screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Infinix GT 10 Pro Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Infinix GT 10 Pro device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Infinix GT 10 Pro screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Infinix GT 10 Pro model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Infinix GT 10 Pro Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

### 1. Restart The Device

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Infinix GT 10 Pro black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Infinix GT 10 Pro's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Infinix GT 10 Pro device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Infinix GT 10 Pro device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Infinix GT 10 Prologo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Infinix GT 10 Pro device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Infinix GT 10 Pro device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Infinix GT 10 Pro device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service
