Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try

If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:

1. **Route4Me**

Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices. The app has integrated AI technology that would let you generate optimum routes based on different parameters.

Users can simply search for any location and generate its optimum route from a selected spot.

There are more than 2 million generated routes by its existing users that you can explore.

The GPX file generator would let you save the route for offline viewing or exporting to another app.

You can generate up to 10 routes for free and can get its premium version to generate more routes.

_Runs on_: iOS and Android

Price: Free or $9.99

One of the easiest and pocket-friendly ways of hacking the OnePlus 12R device is by using the apps that are pre-installed on the phone. Minor changes in the settings of these apps can be made to manipulate them for your spouse who wants to hack your phone. Some of these apps and how they can be used for hacking are as below.

Google Chrome: Changing the logged-in account from yours to his/her will help the hacking spouse to get all the information from the browser like passwords, details of the cards, websites browsed, and more.

- Google Maps or Find My iPhone: When the location sharing option is turned on the victim device, the hacking spouse can track the location easily.
- Google account or iCloud data: If your spouse knows the password of your iCloud or Google account, they will easily have access to all the data that is backed up on iCloud. Further, the data can also be used for cloning your device and getting access to personal information.

### 2\. Tracking apps

A wide range of these spyware tools is available in the market in different price brackets. These spyware apps can retrieve data like chats, call details, messages, browsing history, passwords, and much more.
