## Part 3: How To Catch a Sleeping Snorlax With the Help of Pokémon GO Plus+

With the release of Pokémon GO Plus + in July 2023, Nianticreleased a week-long “Catching Some Z's” event. The main part of the event was to increase the spawned rate for Snorlax and a special encounter with a Snorlax with a nightcap. While the event has long finished, Pokémon GO Plus + remains.

Many users have reported increased sightings of Snorlax even after the event when using Pokémon GO Plus +. As discussed earlier, Pokémon GO Plus + uses Bluetooth to remain connected with the Pokémon GO app. Here are the steps you need to follow to pair Pokémon GO with the Pokémon GO Plus + for help in catching **Pokémon Snorlax sleeping**:

- **Step 1.** Begin by enabling Bluetooth, opening the Pokémon GO app on your device, and tapping the central Pokéball button. Now tap "Settings" from the top right corner and select "Connected Devices and Devices."
