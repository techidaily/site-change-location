## Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max

In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups. There are a lot of different situations in which the Circle is useful. Please make sure everything is where it should be. Since Check-Ins, Location Sharing, and Messaging are all exclusive to each Circle, no one who does not need to view a particular piece of information will. You've got the upper hand here. You have complete control over who is and isn't included in your Circle. Privacy is something we take very seriously.

Paying for a Life360 package gives you access to all the Circles. To ensure that everyone in your Circle is able to take advantage of the perks that come with a Life360 Membership, each paid plan for Life360 includes all members in your Circle.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 Circle?

Life360 is a family safety service that offers a variety of services. Its primary focus is to enable families to communicate and stay in touch with each other.

For parents who want to monitor their children from a distance, Life360 is a valuable tool. It is a mapping system that allows your family members to know exactly where you or anybody else in the Family Circle, where Life 360 circle is located at any specified instant, regardless of whether they are in your house or elsewhere.

Since the technology was introduced in 2014, we can safely say that it is no longer considered revolutionary. But, aside from that, some people want to know more than simply where they are, such as how fast they're going when driving.

## Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?

Life360 has been hailed as an essential tool when it comes to parents and careers. With the help of the Life360 Circle function, the mobile application will track your current position in a ring. Those inside that zone may gain insights about where their kid is heading and track any incoming calls or texts from those who may be concerned about their well-being.

As an added feature, the people concerned may determine whether automatic warnings would appear when someone gets to his location without monitoring him further than only displaying where he paused.

The app will notify you as soon as your beloved person comes or departs from a designated place. You may monitor their speed and position as they drive. In addition, the platform makes it simple to give them instructions by just pressing on their image with life360 circle names.

## Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?

Using the app, you may have observed colorful circles/bubbles. In addition, Life360 tells you about different issues depending on the Circle's color. The app's primary colors are purple, orange, and green.

It's important to know what each color symbolizes before establishing its function. For example, what does the green dot on life360 mean? Members with green rings are more visible. The green dot shows whether driver monitoring is turned on. These also show where everyone in the group is and what they've been up to.

The purple Circle shows a Bluetooth-connected gadget. You may check a member's recent location history using purple dots in the app. For example, to open Day Breakdown, click the purple dots.

The orange Circle denotes a criminal complaint. Instead of a recent crime location, this is a warning that a family member may be in a crime hotspot.

### Method 1: Invest in a Burner Phone

Using an anonymous burner phone purchased with cash is a standard plot device in espionage movies and programs. There is a method that is the same as this for faking Life360.

**Step 1.** Your existing log-in information will work just as well when installing Life360 on your backup phone.

**Step 2.** When you arrive at your destination, connect your burner phone to the Wi-Fi network.

**Step 3.** Don't use Life360 anymore on your phone.

### Method 2: Disable Wi-Fi and Cellular Data Access

Turning down the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device's potential to interact with Wi-Fi and cellular networks is another option for generating a false location.

**Step 1.** To prevent applications from renewing themselves in the background, you must use the option that saves battery life.

![ disable wi-fi and cellular data access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-your-location-2.jpg)

**Step 2.** Disconnect from the internet through Wi-Fi and cellular data if you have them. For example, rather than disabling the whole Android system on an iPhone, you may simply disable the Life 360 app.

**Step 3.** Navigate to the settings menu, look for the Life360 option, and then off cellular data, background refresh, and the Motion & Fitness feature.

Once these services are no longer active, your location data will no longer change.

### Method 3. Go For Dr.Fone
