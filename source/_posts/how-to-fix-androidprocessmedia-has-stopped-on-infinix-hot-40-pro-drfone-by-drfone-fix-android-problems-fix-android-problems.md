### Method 5: Boot your device into safe mode

[Safe mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html) can temporarily disable third-party apps, allowing only core system apps. This detects if a third-party app causes the "Android process media keeps stopping" error. If the problem disappears in safe mode, a third-party app might be the cause. Uninstalling it can restore normal function. If the problem persists in safe mode, a deeper system issue might exist, needing further investigation or support.

- When you install a custom ROM, the issue might occur.

## Part 2: 7 Fixes for the "Unfortunately, Phone Has Stopped" error

### 2.1 Open the Phone app in Safe Mode

First and foremost, the thing that can let you get rid of this trouble is Safe Mode. It is a feature that will end any excessive background functioning of the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device. For instance, your device will be able to run sans any third-party apps when in Safe mode. Since the important functions and the naïve apps will be running on the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device, you will get to know if it’s really a software glitch or not by running the Phone app in Safe mode. And this is the first solution we would recommend you make use of when the Phone app has stopped. Here is how to enable Safe Mode.

1. Switch off the Infinix Hot 40 Pro phone first.
2. Now keep pressing the "Power" button until you see the Infinix Hot 40 Pro logo on the screen.
3. Release the button and immediately press and hold the "Volume Down" key.
4. Leave the key once the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device is in Safe mode. Now, the third-party apps will be disabled and you can check if the Phone app is still not responding or everything is fine.

### 2.2 Clear the cache of the Phone app

The cache should be cleaned timely if you want any app to work properly. Due to the constant usage, the temporary files get collected and may corrupt if not cleared. Hence, the next solution you should try when the Phone app keeps stopping is to clear the cache. Here are the steps to be performed.

1. Open "Settings" on your device and go to "Application" or "Apps".
2. Now from the list of all applications, go to "Phone" and tap on it.
3. Now, click on "Storage" and choose "Clear Cache".

![Phone app crashing - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-phone.jpg)

### 2.3 Update Google Play services

Since Android is created by Google, there must be some Google Play services that are crucial to run several system functions. And if attempting the previous methods isn’t of any use, try updating Google Play services when you find the Phone app stopped. For doing this, you need to make sure that automatic updates are turned on in Google settings. If not, enable it and get the apps including Google Play services updated for smoother functions.

## Ways to Unbrick Your Android Device: Various Ways for Recovery

When your Infinix Hot 40 Pro becomes unresponsive or frozen after mistakenly flashing a ROM or rooting, you are informed that the phone has been bricked. The most terrifying aspect will not just be gadget loss, but also data erasure. However, what exactly is a bricked phone, and, more importantly, how do you fix a bricked Android phone?

This article will explain what a **bricked android phone** is, why an Android phone becomes bricked, how to unbrick an Android phone without losing data and a third-party application you can use.

## Part 1. Causes of Bricked Phones

In everyday settings, our mobile devices have become our greatest friends, therefore breaking your phone is the last thing you want to do. There are different reasons why devices brick, and we must be familiar with them in order to comprehend the various techniques to repair bricked devices.

Here are some common reasons why your Infinix Hot 40 Pro is bricked:

- **Flashing Stock/Custom ROM:**It is possible that you installed an incompatible ROM in the Android phone, that the phone shuts off during the process, or that you have performed other errors that cause your phone to restart indefinitely or to become stuck at the starting screen.
- **Rooting an Android device:**You are unable to effectively root the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device.
- **Android firmware is being updated:**If the phone is interrupted when updating the Android firmware, it will be bricked.
- **Installing harmful applications:**You installed harmful programs on your Infinix Hot 40 Pro, or the phone was infected with a virus.

## Part 2. How to Fix a Bricked Phone

The first step is to establish how badly your device is bricked. In most cases, you will be working with soft bricks that are pretty simple to repair. If your phone is stuck in a boot loop or enters recovery mode every time you turn it on, you may have a soft brick.

To repair bricked Android phones and tablets, you must first thoroughly examine the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device's state. Before you begin troubleshooting, determine the sort of bricking that your phone is experiencing. However, there is no specific software to unbrick your Infinix Hot 40 Pro; you may need to learn the complexities of this issue or hire a professional to do it for you.

### Method 2. Wipe the Cache Partition

This is the first indication that a user's phone has gone bricked. The phone turned on automatically, however it became stuck or frozen on the logo screen. The issue might be caused by the undeleting of data and cache, which prevents the phone from displaying the home screen.

This issue, however, may be resolved by wiping the data and cache partitions in recovery mode. You must do the following to do this:

- **Step 1:** Turn off your smartphone and enter recovery mode by pressing the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously. Different devices have various approaches for entering recovery mode, so you may perform better.
- **Step 2:** After entering recovery mode, you should see the screen below. Remember to pick Advanced and then “Wipe Dalvik Cache” if your device is under Clockwork Mod recovery. Return to the main screen and select “Wipe Cache Partition” once more.

![wipe cache partition](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/Bricked-Android-Phone-2.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Finally, on your smartphone, choose the Reboot system immediately.

### Method 3. Perform a Factory Reset

A factory reset can undo the alterations made to your device that resulted in the brick phone, but you will lose everything you have downloaded and installed in the process. Here's how to restore a bricked Android phone to factory settings:

- **Step 1:** Boot your device into recovery mode (turn off your device, then press **power** button + **volume up** button).
- **Step 2:** Select “**Wipe Data/“Factory Reset”** then confirm the action. When the process is done, you'll be returned to the recovery mode menu.
- **Step 3:** Select **“Reboot System Now”** to restart your device.

### Method 4. Flash a Custom ROM

If you boot your phone directly into recovery mode, there's a problem with the ROM you loaded. Then simply flash the following custom ROM on your phone:

- **Step 2:** Click the **“Install zip from sdcard”** button. Then, select the ZIP file that contains the ROM. Finally, click the **"reboot system now"** button.

## Part 3. How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone

How to prevent a device from “bricking” itself and how to repair it if it does The delay is set by the MCU, but it should be long enough to allow the debug adapter to connect to the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device and halt it before the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device disables itself.

Here are some things to remember to prevent your device from bricking:

- **Avoiding unofficial firmware updates:** Installing unapproved OS firmware on your phone will most certainly violate any manufacturer's warranty you have on it. Read the installation instructions for your unique phone model thoroughly and then carefully follow them, taking time and patience.
- **Being cautious when rooting or jail breaking:**Rooting and Jail breaking disables parts of the operating system's built-in security mechanisms, which are part of what makes the operating system safe, and your data protected from exposure or damage.
- **Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.
- **Backup your phone data regularly:** Backing up your phone safeguards your data in the event that you lose it, it is stolen, or it no longer works. When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.
- **Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:** Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.
