## Part 1. Common Reasons Why Google Pixel 7a Phones Get Bricked

A **bricked phone** might sound like a techy term, but it's pretty simple – when your Google Pixel 7a phone turns into a lifeless block that won't do anything. In this section, you'll learn all about why this happens, so you can avoid these issues and keep your phone alive as long as possible.

- **Trying to flash incompatible ROMs.** Sometimes, people want their Google Pixel 7a phones to run different software like a custom version of Android called a ROM. But if you use the correct ROM for your specific phone, it can mess things up nicely. Also, inexperience with ROM flashing can **hard brick**your **Google Pixel 7a** Be sure to follow guides and ask for community help online.
- **Rooting mishaps/failures.**"Rooting" means giving your phone superpowers, but if you mess up, it can go wrong. Your phone might not boot up, leaving you with a brick. Like the previous bullet, follow guides carefully, especially if inexperienced.
- **Failed Firmware Updates.** When your phone asks you to update its software, following the instructions carefully is essential. If you interrupt the process or something goes wrong, your phone could be bricked.

Now, you must know about soft and hard-bricking to learn how to diagnose your phone. [Soft bricking](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-soft-bricked-android.html) is like a phone's bad day – it might not start up. However, with the right help, you can fix it. Hard bricking is worse. It's when your phone is a paperweight – it won't turn on, respond, or do anything useful.

## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Google Pixel 7a device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Google Pixel 7a device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Google Pixel 7a freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.
- **Consistent Black Screens.**Experiencing recurring black screens could indicate problems within the operating system. In the long run, this might escalate to bricking.
- **Unexpected Reboots and Crashes.**Frequent and unprovoked reboots, app crashes, and system instability might point toward software inconsistencies. Similar to consistent black screens, this could eventually lead to bricking.

### Common Reasons for Your Google Pixel 7a Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Google Pixel 7a devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Failed Updates or Interrupted Installations

When a firmware update is interrupted due to power loss, sudden device shutdown, or other disruptions, it can result in incomplete software installation and potential bricking.

#### Unauthorized User Modifications

Engaging in root access, flashing custom ROMs, or applying unsupported system modifications can destabilize the Google Pixel 7a device's software, paving the way for bricking.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Google Pixel 7a device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Google Pixel 7a device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.

## Part 3: 10 Common Fixes When Google Play Services Won’t Update

### Method 1. Restart your Android and try to update again

In most cases, restarting the Google Pixel 7a device can simply do the trick. When you restart the Google Pixel 7a device, most of the issues get eliminated making the Google Pixel 7a device perform better than before. Also, it is all about RAM. While you restart your device, the RAM gets cleared. As a result, the apps work properly. So, in the first place, we would like you to restart your Google Pixel 7a when you cannot update Google Play Services. Once restarted, try to update again and see if the results are positive.

### Method 2. Uninstall Google Play Services Updates and Reattempt the Update

Uninstalling previous Google Play Services updates resolves conflicts and errors, often addressing the issue of updates. This process clears potential obstacles, enabling a successful update of Google Play Services. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your device's "Settings."
2. Scroll down and select "Apps" or "App Manager."
3. Locate and tap on "Google Play Services."
4. Depending on your device and Android version, you might need to tap on "App info" or "Storage."
5. Look for the option to "Uninstall updates." This will revert Google Play Services to its original version.
6. Confirm the action when prompted.
7. Once the updates are uninstalled, go back to the Google Play Store.
8. Search for "Google Play Services" using the search bar at the top.
9. If an update is available, you'll see the option to "Update." Tap on it to start the update process.
10. After the update is complete, restart your device to ensure the changes take effect.

### Method 3. Update Google Play Store

Ensure that you have the latest version of the Google Play Store app installed on your device. Open the Play Store, go to Settings, and check for updates. Updating the Play Store can often resolve compatibility issues with Google Play Services updates.

### Method 4. Google account and re-add it

Go to your device's Settings, select Accounts or Users, and remove your Google account. Restart your device and add the account again. This process can refresh the connection and resolve update issues.

### Method 5. Uninstall unnecessary apps

As we mentioned above, due to a lot of apps being installed at the same time, the issue can crop up. And hence, if the above solution didn’t help, you can try to uninstall the apps that you don’t need currently. We hope this works. But if not, you can go to the next fix.

### Method 6. Clear Google Play Services cache

If still you cannot update Google Play Services, clearing cache can solve your problem. We also stated this in the beginning as the reason. If you don’t know, cache holds the app’s data temporarily so that it can remember the information when you next open the app. Many times, old cache files get corrupted. And clearing cache can also help in saving storage space on your device. For these reasons, you need to clear cache of Google Play Services to get rid of the problem.

- On opening it, tap “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.

### Method 7. Boot into download mode to clear cache of whole phone

If unfortunately, things are still the same, we would like to recommend you wipe the cache of the whole device to fix the issue.

For this, you need to go to the download mode or recovery mode of your device. Every device has its own steps for this. Like in some, you need to simultaneously press the “Power” and “Volume Down” keys. While in some, the “Power” and both “Volume” keys work.

This is how it works when Google Play Services can't be installed on your device:
