## How to Exit Android Factory Mode On HTC U23?

You’ve often heard that recovery mode will solve just about any problem your HTC U23 is experiencing. This is mostly true and one of the components of Android’s recovery mode, factory mode or [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/wipe-data-factory-reset.html) is one of the most efficient ways to solve various problems on your device. While factory mode is often a good thing, there are times when your device can enter factory mode on its own. Other times, you can safely enter factory mode but not know how to get out.

Fortunately for you, this article will explain all aspects of factory mode and especially how to safely exit factory mode.

## Part 1. What is Android Factory Mode?

Factory mode or what is commonly known as factory reset is one of the options available for you when your HTC U23 is in recovery mode. Several options are available for you once you enter Recovery mode on your device but few are as effective as the wipe data/ factory reset option. This option is useful in solving a whole host of problems that your device could be experiencing.

If you have been using your HTC U23 for a while now and its performance to be less than ideal, a factory reset might be a good solution. That is however not the only problem a factory reset or factory mode can solve. It will also work for a number or Android errors that you may experience, problems caused by faulty firmware updates and also tweaks made on your device that may not have worked as expected.

It is however important to note that a factory reset or factory mode does often result in the loss of all your data. Therefore a backup is necessary to protect against this data loss risk.

## Common Causes of HTC U23 Screen Unresponsiveness

While HTC U23 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an HTC U23 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the HTC U23, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an HTC U23 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the HTC U23 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an HTC U23 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the HTC U23 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the HTC U23 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the HTC U23 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While HTC U23 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid HTC U23 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent HTC U23 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the HTC U23 device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid HTC U23 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the HTC U23 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the HTC U23 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the HTC U23 App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent HTC U23 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data. With features such as System Repair and Data Backup & Restore, you can quickly diagnose and fix software issues that may cause unresponsiveness and safely back up important data to prevent loss in case of device damage or malfunction.

### Conclusion

HTC U23 Screen unresponsiveness can be a frustrating issue to deal with, but there are solutions available. Force restarting the HTC U23 device, checking for software updates, using Dr. Fone Repair, and contacting customer service are all effective ways to solve the problem. However, it's also important to understand the possible causes of the issue, such as soft-bricking or equipment wearing out, and take preventative measures, such as updating your phone on time and avoiding malware. These tips can help prevent HTC U23 Screen unresponsiveness and keep your device running smoothly.
