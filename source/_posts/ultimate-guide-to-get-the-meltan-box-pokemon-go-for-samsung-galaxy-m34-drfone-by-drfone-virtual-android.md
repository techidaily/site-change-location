### Method 3: Reboot the Samsung Galaxy M34 device

This might seems weird but this trick has been working to quiet some time now and has been proven to eliminate the failed location 12 Pokémon Go issue. There is a possibility that the server location is not synced with the Samsung Galaxy M34 device. Restarting the Samsung Galaxy M34 device will make sure that both the locations are sync and the problem is resolved with ease.

Just long-press the power button and choose the reboot option from the menu that appears to complete the process in full.
