## Part 6: How to Find new Pokemons to Level-up in the Game?

Adding friends in Pokemon Go is not enough as you need to have some powerful Pokemon to win battles.

Using this trusted application, you can easily spoof your iPhone location to catch tons of Pokemons.

- You can just connect your iPhone to the application and use its Teleport Mode to spoof your location.
- Users can just enter an address or the coordinates of the target location and further adjust the pin on the map.
- You can also simulate the movement of your iPhone between multiple spots at a preferred speed.
- The interface will include a GPS joystick, letting your move on the map naturally.
- Using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) is extremely simple and it does not need any jailbreak access as well.
