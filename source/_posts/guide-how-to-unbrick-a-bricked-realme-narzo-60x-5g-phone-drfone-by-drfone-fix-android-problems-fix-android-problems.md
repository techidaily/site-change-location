Also, inexperience with ROM flashing can **hard brick**your **Realme Narzo 60x 5G** Be sure to follow guides and ask for community help online.
- **Rooting mishaps/failures.**"Rooting" means giving your phone superpowers, but if you mess up, it can go wrong. Your phone might not boot up, leaving you with a brick. Like the previous bullet, follow guides carefully, especially if inexperienced.

## Realme Narzo 60x 5G Screen Unresponsive? Here's How to Fix It

Realme Narzo 60x 5G phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Realme Narzo 60x 5G touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Realme Narzo 60x 5G phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Realme Narzo 60x 5G touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Realme Narzo 60x 5G Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Realme Narzo 60x 5G phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Realme Narzo 60x 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Realme Narzo 60x 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Realme Narzo 60x 5G device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Realme Narzo 60x 5G screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Realme Narzo 60x 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Realme Narzo 60x 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Realme Narzo 60x 5G Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Realme Narzo 60x 5G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue.

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Realme Narzo 60x 5G black screen problem.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Realme Narzo 60x 5G's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Realme Narzo 60x 5G device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem.

### 3. Contact Custom Service
