## Part 3. How to Fix "Android. Process. Media" Error

With a full backup of your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro, you can now embark on a mission to fix the error. There are several methods to clear this error. We have outlined three of the most effective solutions here.

### Method 1: Ensure app and system updates

Updates often include patches for known issues and vulnerabilities. Ensuring that both apps and the system are up to date can resolve many potential problems.

Step 1: Visit the Google Play Store to check for available app updates.

Step 2: In "Settings," go to "System" > "Software Update" to check for system updates.

### Method 2: Reset app preferences

App preference settings might sometimes lead to conflicts or anomalies. Resetting these settings can revert apps to their default state, resolving potential issues.

Step 1: Go to "Settings" on your device.

Step 2: Access "Apps."

Step 3: Tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner and select "Reset App Preferences."

### Method 3: Clear the cache and data on your device

Step 1: Go to Settings> Applications> Manage Applications and find the Google Services framework.

Step 2: Next, find Google Play from the same Manage Applications page.

Step 3: Tap on it and then Tap on clear cache.

![clear crash](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-process-media-02.jpg)

Step 4: Press the back button to go back to the Google Services framework and then choose Force stop > clear cache > OK

Step 5: Next you need to open Google Play and when presented with an error, click OK

Step 6: Turn off the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device and then turn it back on. Go to the Google Services framework again and turn it on to see if the issue has been resolved.

### Method 4: Check Google Sync & Media Storage settings

Step 1: Go to Settings > Accounts and Personal> Google Sync and uncheck all the checkboxes to stop the Google Synchronization.

Step 2: Disable and Clear all Media Storage data by going to Settings> Apps> All Apps. Find the Media Storage> Clear Data> Disable

Step 3: Use the same method as above to clear the Download Manager data

Step 4: Turn off your device and then turn it on

This Should clear the error message for good.

### Method 5: Boot your device into safe mode

[Safe mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html) can temporarily disable third-party apps, allowing only core system apps. This detects if a third-party app causes the "Android process media keeps stopping" error. If the problem disappears in safe mode, a third-party app might be the cause. Uninstalling it can restore normal function. If the problem persists in safe mode, a deeper system issue might exist, needing further investigation or support.

## Part 4: Boot into Safe Mode to fix Android boot loop

![boot into safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/boot-loop-android.jpg)

Booting your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro into Safe Mode is a useful troubleshooting step to fix boot loop issues caused by third-party apps. When in Safe Mode, the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device will start up with only essential system apps, and any downloaded apps that might be causing conflicts won't run. Here's how you can boot your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:

**Step 1: Power Off Your Device**

Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.

**Step 2: Access Safe Mode**

To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:

- For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer's logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device finishes booting. You should see "Safe Mode" displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.
- Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device's user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.

**Step 3: Observe the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device**

Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn't occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.

**Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps**

Now that you're in Safe Mode, it's time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.

**Step 5: Restart Normally**

Once you've identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.

By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro.

## Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue
