Some players want to fake-locate Mobile Legends because it is highly competitive and it usually ranks globally or locally. Most players prefer local street rankings, which are specified according to the area. The GPS detects the location of the Poco C50 devices in your area while you are in the game. Spoofing your location can bring you new requests and challenges that were practically unavailable in your area.
