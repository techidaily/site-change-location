## Part I: Why Do I Need To Change GPS Location On Tecno Phantom V Flip?

For an average user who uses an Tecno Phantom V Flip to make calls, watch videos, stay productive, and be on top of things, there is no need to change GPS location. However, there are reasons to get a location changer on Tecno Phantom V Flip in case you want to do any of the following:

- play location-aware games such as Pokémon GO
- go on dates outside geographical restrictions imposed by apps
- protect your privacy on websites and apps you visit and use
- access the geo-restricted content catalogs on streaming websites
- play pranks on friends!

## Part II: Can I Spoof My Location On Tecno Phantom V Flip iOS 16? Are There Any Risks?

As we know, iOS 16 has been released, and there are many new features. Therefore, it is a pertinent question: can I use the location spoofer Tecno Phantom V Flip app on iOS 16? Furthermore, what risks are involved in using a GPS spoofer app for Tecno Phantom V Flip?

The answer is YES, you can!

Using this GPS spoofer Tecno Phantom V Flip app on Tecno Phantom V Flip running iOS 16 is possible because this location spoofer Tecno Phantom V Flip app does not run on the Tecno Phantom V Flip at all! So thereby taking away the biggest pain point - you can use this location spoofer on Tecno Phantom V Flip no matter if you're using release version iOS or beta iOS!

About risks, there are zero risks to spoofing your location using a location spoofer Tecno Phantom V Flip app.

## Part III: How To Change GPS Location Without Jailbreak Using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location

Now, let's get right down to the point - which app are we talking about, and how to use this location changer on Tecno Phantom V Flip running iOS 16?

Wondershare Dr.Fone is a comprehensive, multi-module tool to help you with nearly all your daily requirements. Do you want to take regular backups? Use [Phone Backup](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) to take full and selective backups in one click. Did you get locked out of your phone? Use [Screen Unlock](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-unlock.html) to gain access. Accidentally deleted an important video or photo permanently? Not a problem!

Use [System Repair](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-system-repair.html) to fix all issues without data loss in a few clicks. You get the drift here.

Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is another module in the comprehensive arsenal of Dr.Fone that helps you fake GPS iOS 16 without downloading any app on the Tecno Phantom V Flip itself. The advantage here is that you can be running ios 16 and not worry about being unable to spoof location because your favorite location spoofer Tecno Phantom V Flip app is not working on Tecno Phantom V Flip anymore due to iOS 16. Dr.Fone will work because it works from your computer and interacts directly with the Tecno Phantom V Flip without downloading an app to the Tecno Phantom V Flip.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![wondershare drfone software interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 3:** Choose Virtual Location and connect your phone.

![wondershare drfone virtual location module](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4:** Click Get Started. NEW Feature: Tecno Phantom V Flip users are now able to go wireless after setting this up the first time!

The screen shows your real location – as per the actual GPS coordinates of your device.

![drfone virtual location interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

That's it! You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here's how:

**Teleporting To Another Location**

**Step 1:** Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode

**Step 2:** Start typing your destination location and click Go

![drfone virtual location teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3:** You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Tecno Phantom V Flip. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

**Simulating Movement Between Two Points**

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Tecno Phantom V Flip app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

**Step 1:** In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.

**Step 2:** Type your destination and click Go.

**Step 3:** A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

**Step 4:** Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.

**Step 5:** In a new popup, choose if you want to route to repeat and select the number of times. Click Match to start.

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can't deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

![drfone virtual location multi point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 3:** Distance gets re-calculated after each selection. When you are satisfied with your route simulation, click Move Here.

The jailbreakers are only catching up to iOS 15 right now. It is being reported that they are close to jailbreaking iOS 15.

Furthermore, jailbreaking is not recommended in today's age given the security and privacy risks it poses.

### Conclusion

However, anyone can use a location changer on Tecno Phantom V Flip for several other benefits such as breaking the geo-restrictions in dating apps and streaming websites to find dates outside your city limits for free and accessing a catalog of movies and TV shows that is not available in your region due to licensing or other considerations. There are several Tecno Phantom V Flip location spoofer apps in the market, each extolling its virtues. None of them, however, come close to Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) spoofer on Tecno Phantom V Flip given its intuitive interface and ease of use. Not only can you use it on iOS 16 without problem as this app works from a computer, but you also do not have to think about security issues that jailbreaking a device brings because Dr.Fone Virtual Location changer on Tecno Phantom V Flip works without jailbreaking the Tecno Phantom V Flip.
