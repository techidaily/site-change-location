## Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Vivo S17

PPTP, which stands for Point to Point Tunneling Protocol is one of the oldest and most trusted ways of implementing a VPN. It was developed by Microsoft and uses a GRE tunnel with a TCP control channel to bypass various geo-based restrictions. Since free PPTP VPN has been around for years now and is pretty easy to setup, it is quite popular as well. Read on and learn the basics of PPTP VPN free with a free PPTP VPN list as well.

## Part 1: What is PPTP VPN?

The free VPN PPTP was earlier introduced by Windows, but was later adopted by all the other platforms like Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Even though the layer of encryption in free PPTP VPN is not as secure as other protocols, it makes it pretty fast. Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.

- The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.
- Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.
- It supports the 128-bit Point to Point encryption.
- It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).
- Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.
- The tunneling is of two types in PPTP – Voluntary and Compulsory. Voluntary tunneling is initiated from the client’s end while compulsory tunneling is initiated from the server’s end. Compulsory tunneling should be supported by the router.

### [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

iOS system does not contain GPS location spoofing settings, and Apple does not allow GPS spoofer apps in the App Store. Anything you can find in the App Store is not authentic or reliable. There are two viable solutions to [changing iPhone GPS](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-gps-location-ios.html) on the market:

- Using a computer application.
- Turn to VPN service.

A GPS-focused computer application can spoof your location to almost any chosen place in the world and mimic your movement along a predetermined route. On the other hand, a VPN is solely focused on IP addresses, which means it uses a different IP address to change your location.

There is no need to be concerned about compatibility difficulties as it works flawlessly with location-based apps such as Pokemon Go, Snapchat, Life 360, etc. With it, the location cannot limit enjoyment anymore. Not only can you enjoy AR-based games, but you can also change the GPS coordinates of all the social media apps you are using, such as Instagram and Facebook. Also, the list includes dating apps like Tinder and Grinder.
