## Part 1: What Is Life360 And How Does It Work?

The one app that kids hate and parents adore is called Life360.

The app works by sending a request to your cellular carrier to get your location and then sending that information to the Life360 servers. In addition, life360 will store your location and send it to your social networks automatically.

Life360 is not required to track your location, but it is required to send your location to your social networks.
