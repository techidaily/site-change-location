## Part 1: Clear the cache of Settings and Google Play Service

It is possible that the corrupted cache files are responsible for this error. Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:

1. Open “Settings” on your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ and choose “Apps & Notifications”/”Apps”/”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).
2. In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.
3. Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.

![settings crashing - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg)

Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”. Therefore, go accordingly without getting confused.

## Part 2: Clear the Android phone’s RAM and retry

As the next tip, we would like to suggest you clear your device’s RAM by ceasing the running apps in the background. RAM, if at the increased level, is responsible for the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device’s freezing, poor performance, and most probably is the reason behind crashing Settings. Also, if the apps in the background keep running, they might conflict with the Settings and stop it to perform properly. Therefore clearing RAM is important when Android Settings is not responding. Here is how to do it.

1. Firstly, you need to go to the Recent apps screen. For this, long-press the Home key.  
    Note: Please note that different devices have different ways to go to the Recent apps screen. Do it according to the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device you own.
2. Now, swipe the apps and tap on the clear option. You will be able to notice the amount of RAM cleared

![settings crashing - clear ram](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-ram.jpg)

## Part 3: Uninstall the Google update

Uninstalling Google Play Store updates has also responded well to many users. It has worked in the case of the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” error. So, we would also like to suggest you use this tip if the others don’t work. Here are the steps to be followed for this.

1. Open “Settings” on your Android and tap on “Application manager” or “Apps” or “Application.
2. Now, head to all the apps and select “Google Play Store” from there.
3. Tap on “Uninstall Updates” and restart your device to check if the crashing Settings issue has been resolved.
