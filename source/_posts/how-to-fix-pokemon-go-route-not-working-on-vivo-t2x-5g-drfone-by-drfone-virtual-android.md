## Part 1. How Do Routes in Pokemon Go Work?

The logic behind the Pokemon Go Routes is very simple. There are only two things you need to remember about it. First, you can record a walking path anywhere and submit it for review.

Afterward, you can obtain special rewards and extra bonus points upon its completion.

## Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?

All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.

There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.

When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.

#### Instructions for Getting Pokémon GO Fire Red Rare Candy Without Walking/Moving

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location offers a simple and easy-to-understand way to spoof your location when playing Pokémon GO. The following are the steps you need to follow for location spoofing:

**Step 1: Connect to Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and Set Target Location**

With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location launched on your computer, connect your smartphone. Once on the map screen, click the "Teleport Mode" icon, the first one, from the toolbar near the top-right corner. Now tap the search bar on the top left corner, enter the targeted location, and press "Enter."

**Step 2: Teleport to Targeted Location**

The cursor on the map screen will move to the location you have entered on the map. If you want to move there when spoofing your location, click "Move Here." It will change the location on the map screen and on your device to the location you entered. You can confirm it by accessing your smartphone and opening a map application.

Now, choose the stop points, type of trip, walking speed, and other parameters. Once you are done, tap "Move Here" or "Start Moving" to initiate the movement.
