## Part 4: Boot into Safe Mode to fix Android boot loop

![boot into safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/boot-loop-android.jpg)

Booting your Honor X50 into Safe Mode is a useful troubleshooting step to fix boot loop issues caused by third-party apps. When in Safe Mode, the Honor X50 device will start up with only essential system apps, and any downloaded apps that might be causing conflicts won't run. Here's how you can boot your Honor X50 into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:

**Step 1: Power Off Your Device**

Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.

**Step 2: Access Safe Mode**

To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:

- For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer's logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Honor X50 device finishes booting. You should see "Safe Mode" displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.
- Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device's user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.

**Step 3: Observe the Honor X50 device**

Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn't occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.

**Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps**

Now that you're in Safe Mode, it's time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.

**Step 5: Restart Normally**

Once you've identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.

By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Honor X50.

## Part 1: Clear the cache of Settings and Google Play Service

## Part 1: Understanding Bricked Honor X50

Have you ever heard the term "bricked" concerning your Honor X50 device? This section explains it to you in simple terms.

### Common Causes of a Brick Honor X50

Something might go wrong during the process when you're trying to update your Honor X50 device. This is properly because of a poor internet connection or other interruptions. As a result, your device might get confused and end up bricked.

- **Custom ROM Installations**

A custom ROM is like a customized version of your device's software. While it can bring cool new features, it can also cause issues if not installed correctly. Incompatible or poorly made custom ROMs can sometimes lead to a bricked device.

- **Unauthorized Modifications**

If you're trying to tweak your device's software without proper knowledge, you might make changes that the Honor X50 device can't handle. This can lead to instability and, you guessed it, a bricked device.
