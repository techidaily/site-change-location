## Part 1: What is PPTP VPN?

The free VPN PPTP was earlier introduced by Windows, but was later adopted by all the other platforms like Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Even though the layer of encryption in free PPTP VPN is not as secure as other protocols, it makes it pretty fast. Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.

- The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.
- Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.
- It supports the 128-bit Point to Point encryption.
- It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).
- Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.
- The tunneling is of two types in PPTP – Voluntary and Compulsory. Voluntary tunneling is initiated from the client’s end while compulsory tunneling is initiated from the server’s end. Compulsory tunneling should be supported by the router.

### How to use the joystick for flexible and smooth GPS control

- The joystick feature is located in the teleport option at the upper-right corner in the 5th location.

### How to simulate movement along the route using 2 spot location

- Go to “One-Stop mode” at the corner on top.
- Select the spot on the map you wish to go. The pop-up will tell you how far it is.
- Drag the slider to select how fast you wish to move. Choose between cycling, walking, and driving. Let's take cycling for example.
- Enter a number to decide how many times you want to cycle between the two locations. Now click “Move Here”. Your character will start moving.

### How to export and import GPX location

- Click the export button to store the path as a GPX file
- Import the shared GPX file to your Dr. Fone Virtual Location.
- Download it from another website. Now click the “Open” button.
- Wait some time to complete the import process. Once done, it is now ready for use.

### How to teleport anywhere around the globe

- Firstly download the Dr. Fone Virtual Location app. Though the app's current version has an old interface, the functionality is cleared from any glitches. The latest interface will soon be available. Now click on the “Virtual Location” from the options and connect your Android/ iPhone to your computer, and hit “Get Started”.

- Now in the window, find your existing location on your map with the help of the “center on” icon, which is located on the right sidebar. You will go to your current location upon clicking.

- Now hit “teleport mode” at the top right. Enter your desired teleport located and hit the “Go” icon. Let's visit Rome for this example.
- You have successfully teleported to Rome. Click “Move Here”
- Now your location is fixed to Rome.

### How to add your route as a favorite

- On your virtual location screen, click on the five-star beside the route and add it to your favorite.
- Once you have added, hit the five-star icon again at the right-sidebar and locate the route you wish to use. Now hit the “Move” button and start walking along your favorite route again.

### How to simulate movement along the route using multi-spot

- Choose multi-spot mode at the top right corner.
- The left sidebar tells how far it will travel to reach the location. Now set the moving speed and specify the number of times to cycle between the locations. Now click “Start Moving”.
