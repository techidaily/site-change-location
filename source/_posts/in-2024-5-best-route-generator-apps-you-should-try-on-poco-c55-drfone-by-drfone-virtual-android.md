## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Poco C55

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try

If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:

1. **Route4Me**

Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices. The app has integrated AI technology that would let you generate optimum routes based on different parameters.

Users can simply search for any location and generate its optimum route from a selected spot.

The GPX file generator would let you save the route for offline viewing or exporting to another app.

You can generate up to 10 routes for free and can get its premium version to generate more routes.

### Key Features of Fake GPS Location Pro

To know more about this location spoofing application, it is necessary for you to go across the features of the tool. This will help you learn more about the technicalities involved in location spoofing on Android devices:

**1\. Different Map Types**

There is not a single form of display of maps available on this application. You can observe the map in the "Normal" display, followed by a "Terrain," "Satellite," and "Hybrid" display. The variety of map display types gives you the leverage of observing the location deeply. You can ensure that the location you're shifting your device to is appropriate and tangible in all conditions.

**2\. History**

Anything location that has been searched and changed is saved in the "History" section of this application. **Fake GPS Location Pro** keeps a catalog of the history of locations that you have spoofed. This gives you better accessibility in situations where you have to change the location again.

**3\. Set Favorites**

You can set different locations as "Favorites" to give you better access to locations when you are looking forward to spoofing your device's location. This tool offers you the option of saving more time and effort in changing location every time.

**4\. Joystick and Movement**

Unlike other location spoofing tools, **Fake GPS Pro APK** provides the option of a virtual joystick for moving around the location with ease. You can witness fake movements on the map using the joystick and simulate movements with the help of designated spots on the map.

## Part 3: User Reviews for Fake GPS Location Pro

Are you still confused about the performance of this location spoofer app? We have provided some user reviews below to help you out:

| Reviewer | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Bobby Nichols | "I was using a different app for quite some time. However, if My Poco C55 was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Poco C55 sit untouched for an hour..... YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!" |
| Brian Thompson. | "Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren't available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you'd charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user." |
| Gerald | "It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text. If you send the link via Google maps the recipient has to press the play store link to see your location. What if they are not using an android phone? Also very sluggish." |
