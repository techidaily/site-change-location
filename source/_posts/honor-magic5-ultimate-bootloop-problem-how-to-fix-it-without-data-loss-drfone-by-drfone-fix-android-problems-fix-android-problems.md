![boot into safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/boot-loop-android.jpg)

Booting your Honor Magic5 Ultimate into Safe Mode is a useful troubleshooting step to fix boot loop issues caused by third-party apps.

**Step 3: Observe the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device**

Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn't occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.

**Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps**

Now that you're in Safe Mode, it's time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.

**Step 5: Restart Normally**

Once you've identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.

By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Honor Magic5 Ultimate.

## Part 1: What Are the Causes Behind Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

There are many reasons for ****the app crashing**** on Android devices. These reasons range from insufficient storage space to bugs and glitches in the apps. Finding out the root cause of an app crashing is important so that you can find the appropriate solution. Discussed below are some of the reasons why your Android apps keep crashing:

### Insufficient Memory

When a device is low on memory, it may struggle to run multiple apps simultaneously. Each app requires memory to store its data and execute its processes. If the available memory is limited, it can cause apps to crash. That happens because they don't have enough resources to operate properly.

### Software Compatibility

Android devices come in various models and run different operating system versions. That's why it is essential to use apps compatible with your device. Since there are a lot of Android variants, it is hard to optimize apps for all devices. An app not optimized for an Android version or device leads to crashes or malfunctions.

### Outdated Apps

Apps are regularly updated to introduce new features, fix bugs, and enhance performance. Using an outdated version of an app may cause instability or compatibility problems. Since the app is not optimized for the current version of Android, it can keep crashing.

### Network Problems

Some apps rely heavily on network connectivity to function properly. They need a stable and strong internet connection to perform all the functions. These apps can crash if there are network connectivity issues, such as a weak Wi-Fi or network outage. Unstable connections can disrupt data transmission, making the app's function challenging.

### App Bugs

Despite rigorous testing, apps can still have bugs or coding errors that lead to crashes. Bugs in apps can occur due to various reasons. It mostly relates to incorrect implementation of features or unexpected user interactions. App developers work to identify and fix these bugs, often releasing updates.

### Reset Factory settings

If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.

Along with this, we would also suggest you go take backup of your data so that you won’t lose any of the personal information from your device after performing factory reset. For your convenience, we have stated the backup steps too in the following guide. Have a look:

- Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup & Reset”.
- Notice if “Back up my data” is enabled or not. If not, turn it on and create backup.
- Now, scroll for “Factory Data reset” option and confirm it by clicking “Reset Phone”.

![reset factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/reset-factory-settings.jpg)

- Wait a few minutes and your device will reboot.

### Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz

We believe that you will find the above methods helpful. However, if still in case your **_TouchWiz is not working_**, we advice you that you should install a new theme launcher in your device. It will be a wise option to ditch TouchWiz in such scenario rather than tolerating the problem. Hope this advice will help you.
