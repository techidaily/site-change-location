![Enter details of the cheat code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/my-boy-pokemon-fire-red-cheat-codes-5.jpg)

**Step 4 –** Enter the Pokéstop and deactivate the cheat code.

**Step 5 –** Go to your computer and type in “PC > Item Storage”.

**Step 6 –** Withdraw a SINGLE Rare Candy

**Step 7 –** check if you have double Rare Candy entries in your storage. If they are not duplicated, then the cheat has worked as it should. If they are duplicated, then you have to close the game and redo all the steps above.

**Step 8 –** Now exit and then go back to your Item Storage, where you can withdraw as many Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candies as you would want. Simply pick a number between 001 and 999, but never use the down arrow.
