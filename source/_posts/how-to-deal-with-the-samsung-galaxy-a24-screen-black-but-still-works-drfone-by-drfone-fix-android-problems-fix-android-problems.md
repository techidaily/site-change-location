### App Troubles

If your **phone is working, but the screen is black,** there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application. An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.

### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software. This problem suggests that your Samsung Galaxy A24 is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately. If this is the cause, then your device is likely experiencing a critical system error, and you should directly try to reboot your phone.

### Hardware Problem

If you dropped your phone, there’s a high chance the LCD connectors went loose due to the physical impact. If this happened to you, the phone might be working, but the screen is black due to the LCD cable dislodging. Another issue could be your phone got exposed to extreme temperatures. This can also cause a **black screen but your phone is still on.**

4. If there are any connected hardware e.g. SD card, remove them from the Samsung Galaxy A24 device.
5. Start your Samsung Galaxy A24 in **Safe Mode** by pressing and holding down the **Menu** or **Volume Down** button on your device.
6. Should the first five steps do not work for you, perform a hard reset. Do take note that each device will have a different way to do so and that data that is stored locally on the phone will be deleted.
7. Send your Samsung Galaxy A24 to the repair shop should none of these steps work.

## Common Causes of Samsung Galaxy A24 Screen Unresponsiveness

While Samsung Galaxy A24 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Samsung Galaxy A24 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Samsung Galaxy A24, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Samsung Galaxy A24 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Samsung Galaxy A24 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Samsung Galaxy A24 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Samsung Galaxy A24 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Samsung Galaxy A24 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Samsung Galaxy A24 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Samsung Galaxy A24 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Samsung Galaxy A24 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent Samsung Galaxy A24 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Samsung Galaxy A24 device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid Samsung Galaxy A24 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Samsung Galaxy A24 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Samsung Galaxy A24 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Samsung Galaxy A24 App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Samsung Galaxy A24 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data. With features such as System Repair and Data Backup & Restore, you can quickly diagnose and fix software issues that may cause unresponsiveness and safely back up important data to prevent loss in case of device damage or malfunction.

### Conclusion

Samsung Galaxy A24 Screen unresponsiveness can be a frustrating issue to deal with, but there are solutions available. Force restarting the Samsung Galaxy A24 device, checking for software updates, using Dr. Fone Repair, and contacting customer service are all effective ways to solve the problem. However, it's also important to understand the possible causes of the issue, such as soft-bricking or equipment wearing out, and take preventative measures, such as updating your phone on time and avoiding malware. These tips can help prevent Samsung Galaxy A24 Screen unresponsiveness and keep your device running smoothly.
