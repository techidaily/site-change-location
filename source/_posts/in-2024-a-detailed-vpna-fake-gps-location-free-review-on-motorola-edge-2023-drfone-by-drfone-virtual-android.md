## Part 3: One-stop Tool to Change GPS Location on iOS and Android

Although VPNs provide a great way to **change** **YouTube** **TV** **location** through IP address, it still lacks accuracy with the location. To be more precise with region accuracy, [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) changes GPS location to connect your Motorola Edge 2023 with a particular area in a specific city. As VPNs change the location by connecting to the city’s server via IP address, Dr.Fone targets the exact location in any city by using GPS.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location helps the users locate a precise location for YouTube TV to access specific TV channels and features. Moreover, you can instantly **change** your **YouTube** **TV** **location** with a single click. Using this tool, you can fake your location anywhere in the world with excellent speed.

For **changing YouTube TV location** through Dr.Fone, use the below instructions:

**Step 1: Navigate Virtual Location**

Download Dr.Fone on your computer and open its main home page. Select “Virtual Location” from the displayed options by clicking on it. Now connect your smartphone to your computer via a USB cable.
