## **Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify**

Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.

**Region Specific Content**

The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.

**Geo-Based Suggestions**

![sopify playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg)

Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.

**But is Spotify available everywhere?**

How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.

The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.

## **Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone**

Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content. To make that possible, you can use some of the best online tools to fake spotify location whenever you want. Instead of going for the regular Spotify Update Location, you can use these third-party applications to change the location on your iPhone devices (will reflect in Spotify too).

## **Part 3: Best Tools for Fake GPS on Android**

We have seen how to chive the Spotify Location update using the tools that work great in iPhones. In fact, you can use Dr. Fone on Android as well. Here are some other efficient GPS Faking tools that you can specifically use with your Vivo Y100s.

**Hola Fake GPS**

Hola Fake GPS is a direct Android app that you can use to change country on Spotify.

**Step 1:** In the Google Play Store, Search for ‘Fake GPS-Location - Hola’. The app appears with a smiley pin-point as an icon. Click on that and install on your Vivo Y100.

**Step 2:** Now, a map will appear showing your current location in the world. You can shift the pin to a new location or simply type the address into search bar.

![spotify location shift](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-spotify-shift-pic19.jpg)

**Step 3:** The location pin will slowly start moving from current location to new location. At any point if you want to ‘STOP’, you can click on the Stop button that is present on the screen at this point.

## **Part 4: How to use a VPN to change Spotify Location?**

The Virtual Private Network apps will change your server and your location and IP address will be masked completely. We suggest that you use NordVPN, that is quite easy to work with.

**Step 1:** Download NordVPN from the App Store or Google Play Store

![nordvpn app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic24.jpg)

**Step 2:** To change Location on Spotify, Sign Up and NordVPN will find the nearest server for you.

**Step 3:** If you do not prefer the server that they connected to you, disconnect from that server. You can update location on spotify using another server.
