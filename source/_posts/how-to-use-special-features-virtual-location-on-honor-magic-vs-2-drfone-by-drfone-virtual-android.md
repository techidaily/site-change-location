You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Honor Magic Vs 2 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone's geographic location.
