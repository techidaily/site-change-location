## **What causes a Realme 12 Pro 5G Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Realme 12 Pro 5G phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Realme 12 Pro 5G device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Realme 12 Pro 5G smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Realme 12 Pro 5G 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

### **There might be issues with the Realme 12 Pro 5G device itself**

Screens on Realme 12 Pro 5G devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every Realme 12 Pro 5G device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.

## Part 1. Causes of Bricked Phones

In everyday settings, our mobile devices have become our greatest friends, therefore breaking your phone is the last thing you want to do. There are different reasons why devices brick, and we must be familiar with them in order to comprehend the various techniques to repair bricked devices.

Here are some common reasons why your Realme 12 Pro 5G is bricked:

- **Flashing Stock/Custom ROM:**It is possible that you installed an incompatible ROM in the Android phone, that the phone shuts off during the process, or that you have performed other errors that cause your phone to restart indefinitely or to become stuck at the starting screen.
- **Rooting an Android device:**You are unable to effectively root the Realme 12 Pro 5G device.
- **Android firmware is being updated:**If the phone is interrupted when updating the Android firmware, it will be bricked.
- **Installing harmful applications:**You installed harmful programs on your Realme 12 Pro 5G, or the phone was infected with a virus.

## Part 2. How to Fix a Bricked Phone

The first step is to establish how badly your device is bricked. In most cases, you will be working with soft bricks that are pretty simple to repair. If your phone is stuck in a boot loop or enters recovery mode every time you turn it on, you may have a soft brick.

To repair bricked Android phones and tablets, you must first thoroughly examine the Realme 12 Pro 5G device's state. Before you begin troubleshooting, determine the sort of bricking that your phone is experiencing. However, there is no specific software to unbrick your Realme 12 Pro 5G; you may need to learn the complexities of this issue or hire a professional to do it for you.

### Method 1. Reboot the Phone in Safe Mode

Trying to reboot your android device in safe mode is the first and easiest thing you should try if your phone is bricked. Here's how to do it:

- **Step 1:** Turn off your smartphone and press the **Volume Up** + **Power** button to enter recovery mode. Then, using the volume controls, navigate the menu and select Reboot system now.

![android safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/Bricked-Android-Phone-1.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Turn off your smartphone and enter recovery mode by pressing the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously. Different devices have various approaches for entering recovery mode, so you may perform better.
- **Step 2:** After entering recovery mode, you should see the screen below. Remember to pick Advanced and then “Wipe Dalvik Cache” if your device is under Clockwork Mod recovery. Return to the main screen and select “Wipe Cache Partition” once more.

## Part 3. How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone

How to prevent a device from “bricking” itself and how to repair it if it does The delay is set by the MCU, but it should be long enough to allow the debug adapter to connect to the Realme 12 Pro 5G device and halt it before the Realme 12 Pro 5G device disables itself.

Here are some things to remember to prevent your device from bricking:

- **Avoiding unofficial firmware updates:** Installing unapproved OS firmware on your phone will most certainly violate any manufacturer's warranty you have on it. Read the installation instructions for your unique phone model thoroughly and then carefully follow them, taking time and patience.
- **Being cautious when rooting or jail breaking:**Rooting and Jail breaking disables parts of the operating system's built-in security mechanisms, which are part of what makes the operating system safe, and your data protected from exposure or damage.
- **Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.
- **Backup your phone data regularly:** Backing up your phone safeguards your data in the event that you lose it, it is stolen, or it no longer works. When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.
- **Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:** Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.

## Conclusion

It is certainly upsetting when your gadget bricks, but you may attempt the solutions listed above to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, if you want to solve the problem quickly and easily, you can try Wondershare Dr.Fone. It can not only help you repair your Android smartphone, but it can also help you extract data from a bricked device, recover data, and many more Android device solutions!
