## Part 1. Common Reasons Why Itel P55+ Phones Get Bricked

A **bricked phone** might sound like a techy term, but it's pretty simple – when your Itel P55+ phone turns into a lifeless block that won't do anything. In this section, you'll learn all about why this happens, so you can avoid these issues and keep your phone alive as long as possible.

- **Trying to flash incompatible ROMs.** Sometimes, people want their Itel P55+ phones to run different software like a custom version of Android called a ROM. But if you use the correct ROM for your specific phone, it can mess things up nicely. Also, inexperience with ROM flashing can **hard brick**your **Itel P55+** Be sure to follow guides and ask for community help online.
- **Rooting mishaps/failures.**"Rooting" means giving your phone superpowers, but if you mess up, it can go wrong. Your phone might not boot up, leaving you with a brick. Like the previous bullet, follow guides carefully, especially if inexperienced.
- **Failed Firmware Updates.** When your phone asks you to update its software, following the instructions carefully is essential. If you interrupt the process or something goes wrong, your phone could be bricked.

Now, you must know about soft and hard-bricking to learn how to diagnose your phone. [Soft bricking](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-soft-bricked-android.html) is like a phone's bad day – it might not start up. However, with the right help, you can fix it.

### 1\. Why Did My iPhone Screen Go Black After Not Responding to Touch?

Your iPhone screen with a **touch issue** will sometimes go black after not responding to touch due to several issues. It could be hardware, software, issues with a particular app, software crash, or you have a low battery. If it’s a drained battery, you’re in luck; all you have to do is charge it. Otherwise, you’ll have to perform a force restart on your iPhone to try to reboot it.

### 2\. How Do I Keep My Android From Crashing?

Keeping your apps updated should help you solve app crashing issues that can impact your Android OS. These apps build up large caches throughout your normal usage. Clearing cached data from time to time can drastically improve your smartphone’s performance and prevent **touch issues**. To remove your app cache, go to **Settings** \> **Storage** and tap **Cached Data**.

### 3\. Can I Use Dr.Fone for Free?
