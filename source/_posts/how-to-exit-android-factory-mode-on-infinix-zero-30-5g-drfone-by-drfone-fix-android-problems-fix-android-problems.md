We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Infinix Zero 30 5G touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Infinix Zero 30 5G Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Infinix Zero 30 5G phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Infinix Zero 30 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot.

For example, some Infinix Zero 30 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Infinix Zero 30 5G device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Infinix Zero 30 5G screens to become unresponsive.

These issues can also occur in any Infinix Zero 30 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Infinix Zero 30 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.
