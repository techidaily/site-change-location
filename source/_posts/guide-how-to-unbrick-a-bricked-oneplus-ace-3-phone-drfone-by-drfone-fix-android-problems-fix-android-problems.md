## What Causes A OnePlus Ace 3 Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a OnePlus Ace 3 phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of OnePlus Ace 3 screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some OnePlus Ace 3 Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the OnePlus Ace 3 device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause OnePlus Ace 3 screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any OnePlus Ace 3 model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, OnePlus Ace 3 Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the OnePlus Ace 3 black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix OnePlus Ace 3's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the OnePlus Ace 3 device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a OnePlus Ace 3 device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the OnePlus Ace 3logo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Leaving the OnePlus Ace 3 device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the OnePlus Ace 3 device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the OnePlus Ace 3 device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.
