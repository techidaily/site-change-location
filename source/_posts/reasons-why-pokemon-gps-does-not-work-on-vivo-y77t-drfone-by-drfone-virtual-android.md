**Step 1:** Open the Pokemon Let’s Go app.

**Step 2:** In Fuschia City, talk to the Go Park Complex Attendant and select the “Bring Pokemon” option.

**Step 4:** In the map view, tap on the button “Main menu”.

**Step 5:** Then, tap the “Pokemon” Button.

**Step 6:** At the top-right section of your screen, you will find the “Nintendo Switch”, tap on that.

**Step 7:** Now select the Pokemon you want to transfer. Please note that you can only send the Pokemon you have originally discovered in the Kanto Region.

### Tip No.2: Transfer Pokemon to Friend’s Switch

If you cannot establish a pair with your Nintendo Switch, you can always look for your friends. In case you don’t have a Nintendo Switch with a copy of Let’s Go Pikachu, do not worry. You can still obtain a shiny meltan pokemon go mystery box. You can send Pokemon to your friend’s Nintendo switch and bang… you get the chance to catch the mythical pokemon.
