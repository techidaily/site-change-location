Did you know that your Apple iPhone X tracks your location even when turned off? And if you're a member of any social media network, it means you could be tracked. Do you like to have your privacy? Do you want to protect your kids from being tracked by strangers?

Of course Yes! Well, then you should know that Your Apple iPhone X can track your movements even when switched off. But is that true?

In the event that you switch off your Apple iPhone X, the GPS function will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your Apple iPhone X is turned off. However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data that was uploaded to your account.

Should we trust Life360, the social media company that recently merged with Google, to protect our privacy? Let's take a look at the facts.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 And How Does It Work?

The one app that kids hate and parents adore is called Life360. Life360 is monitoring software that can be downloaded into your Apple iPhone X and used by the individuals who are part of your Family Circle to monitor your location and the location of anybody else who is part of your Family Circle.

The app works by sending a request to your cellular carrier to get your location and then sending that information to the Life360 servers. In addition, life360 will store your location and send it to your social networks automatically.

Life360 is not required to track your location, but it is required to send your location to your social networks.

If you want to know more about Life360, check out our Life360 Review.

When it comes to privacy, many people are becoming more aware of how it is being violated. As a result, there's no need to worry about whether or not the monitoring app in concern is as trustworthy as Life360.

Disconnecting from Life360 is as simple as turning off your Apple iPhone X and preventing the app from following and reporting your every step. Unfortunately, it also means that no one can see where they are about one another or how long it has been since they last updated their position.

If the necessity ever arose, such an undertaking may be useful for maintaining one's privacy. However, customers have no idea that Life 360 may still be used to monitor them by other people.

Premium users will still have access to the last 30 days' worth of location data, so the other person will be able to see where you were last seen.

## Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You

### 1\. Low Data Consumption

Disabling Life360's Wi-Fi and Data may result in a warning to parents that their children are offline so that they can keep an eye on their kids. Does life 360 drain the battery? Low data mode is a better option for turning off life360 without alerting your parents. Go to the Settings and locate Life360; however, do not deactivate the exact location.

Alternatively, you should disable background app refresh, mobile network, physical activity, and WIFI to save battery life. An issue with your Internet connection will come up instead of location stopped in this situation. So don't connect to any Wi-Fi at all.

### 2\. Fake Locations

Using location spoofing applications on an Android smartphone, your kids can fool you into thinking they're somewhere else. [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is a location spoofing application that will trick you into thinking that you are in a different location than you really are. The GPS position of the Apple iPhone X device will be updated to reflect the new place that you have chosen thanks to the software. It is worth noting that Dr. Fone - Virtual Location for iOS may also enable you to imitate GPS movement.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Setting Wi-Fi and Data Services to "Off."

Another typical method kids use to prevent their parents from monitoring their position is to disable Life360's Wi-Fi and Data. It works like this. If you don't want applications updating in the background, enable power-saving mode.

Use a wired connection. Adolescents can turn off Wi-Fi and data when using the Life360 app on an iPhone. Go to Settings, look for Life360, and disable Cellular Data, Background Refresh, and Motion & Fitness. You'll be able to keep track of where you are on Life360.

![low data consumption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg)

All these methods can be used to Stop Life360 from Tracking You. However, the best all-in-one solution is a third-party application called Dr.Fone. This Virtual Location Software helps you keep your tracking off, but you can also fake your location very easily in minutes.

### Key Features of Fake GPS Location Pro

To know more about this location spoofing application, it is necessary for you to go across the features of the tool. This will help you learn more about the technicalities involved in location spoofing on Android devices:

**1\. Different Map Types**

Anything location that has been searched and changed is saved in the "History" section of this application. **Fake GPS Location Pro** keeps a catalog of the history of locations that you have spoofed. This gives you better accessibility in situations where you have to change the location again.

## Part 3: User Reviews for Fake GPS Location Pro

Are you still confused about the performance of this location spoofer app? We have provided some user reviews below to help you out:

| Reviewer | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Bobby Nichols | "I was using a different app for quite some time. However, if My Apple iPhone X was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Apple iPhone X sit untouched for an hour..... YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!" |
| Brian Thompson. | "Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren't available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you'd charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user." |
| Gerald | "It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text. If you send the link via Google maps the recipient has to press the play store link to see your location. What if they are not using an android phone? Also very sluggish." |

## A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On Apple iPhone X

As I stumbled upon this query that has been recently posted on a leading online forum, I realized that so many people don't know about the VPNa Fake GPS app. If you are also an Android user who would like to change your device's location, then VPNa Fake GPS APK might meet your requirements. Since there are so many location spoofing tools out there, I decided to give VPNa Fake GPS location app a try and have come up with its genuine review here.

## Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More

Developed by XdoApp, VPNa Fake GPS is a popular application that can change the location of your Android virtually. Using it, you can spoof your device location to almost anywhere in the world. This would be reflected in almost all the installed gaming, dating, and other apps on your phone automatically.

- You can look for any location on the interface of VPNa Fake GPS by entering keywords (name/address) or the exact coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the place.
- To fake GPS using VPNa, you would be presented with a map-like interface and can easily move the pin around to spoof your location to an exact place.
- Besides that, if there is a location that you change frequently, then you can also mark it as a favorite.
- The VPNa fake GPS location APK would also maintain the record of the past locations that you have spoofed.
- Using VPNa Fake GPS, you can change your location as many times as you want without paying anything.

**_Pros_**

- The changed location would be reflected in almost every dating and gaming app.
- The basic version of VPNa Fake GPS is available for free and doesn't need root access.
- The overall interface of VPNa Fake GPS APK is pretty user-friendly and smooth.

**_Cons_**

- At times, some advanced apps (like Pokemon Go) can detect it and might get your account banned.
- While using the free VPNa fake GPS version, you would get in-app ads.
- Sometimes, the location is not spoofed even after consecutive attempts.

**_Pricing_**: While you can access the basic version of VPNa Fake GPS for free, you can pay $2.99 for an ad-free experience.

**_Compatibility_**: Android 4.4 and newer versions

**_Play Store Rating:_** 3.6/5

**_Important Note_**

Don't get confused by the name of VPNa Fake GPS as it is not a VPN, but only a location spoofing solution. If you are looking for a VPN app, then you should consider other options.

**_Final Verdict_**

Overall, VPNa Fake GPS location free is worth a try. It is pretty lightweight, easy-to-use, and supports almost all the prominent apps. Since you don't have to pay anything to use VPNa Fake GPS, you can give it a try, and explore it on your own.
