### [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

iOS system does not contain GPS location spoofing settings, and Apple does not allow GPS spoofer apps in the App Store. Anything you can find in the App Store is not authentic or reliable.

- Using a computer application.

Also, the list includes dating apps like Tinder and Grinder.

#### Step 2: Decide the Route You Want to Simulate

To simulate movement on the map, Dr.Fone - Virtual Location offers two types of modes, “One-Stop Route” and “Multi-Stop Route.” They are the third and fourth options on the toolbar at the top right corner. In both modes, you can decide on the start and end points to define the speed of movement. You can also decide if the trip is round or in the loop.

#### Step 3: Use Joystick for Ultra-Realistic Movement

If you want more realistic and flexible movements, you can use the joystick feature of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. It is the 5<sup>th</sup> option on the top right corner toolbar. After selecting it, you can go for either automatic movements or manual movements. In automatic movement, you only need to specify the directions, while manual movement gives you full control over where you want to go and how to do it.
