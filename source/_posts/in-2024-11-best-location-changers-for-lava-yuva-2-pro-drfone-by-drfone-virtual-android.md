### [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

iOS system does not contain GPS location spoofing settings, and Apple does not allow GPS spoofer apps in the App Store. Anything you can find in the App Store is not authentic or reliable. There are two viable solutions to [changing iPhone GPS](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-gps-location-ios.html) on the market:

- Using a computer application.
- Turn to VPN service.

A GPS-focused computer application can spoof your location to almost any chosen place in the world and mimic your movement along a predetermined route. On the other hand, a VPN is solely focused on IP addresses, which means it uses a different IP address to change your location.

There is no need to be concerned about compatibility difficulties as it works flawlessly with location-based apps such as Pokemon Go, Snapchat, Life 360, etc. With it, the location cannot limit enjoyment anymore. Not only can you enjoy AR-based games, but you can also change the GPS coordinates of all the social media apps you are using, such as Instagram and Facebook. Also, the list includes dating apps like Tinder and Grinder.

To simulate movement on the map, Dr.Fone - Virtual Location offers two types of modes, “One-Stop Route” and “Multi-Stop Route.” They are the third and fourth options on the toolbar at the top right corner.

If you want more realistic and flexible movements, you can use the joystick feature of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. It is the 5<sup>th</sup> option on the top right corner toolbar. After selecting it, you can go for either automatic movements or manual movements. In automatic movement, you only need to specify the directions, while manual movement gives you full control over where you want to go and how to do it.
