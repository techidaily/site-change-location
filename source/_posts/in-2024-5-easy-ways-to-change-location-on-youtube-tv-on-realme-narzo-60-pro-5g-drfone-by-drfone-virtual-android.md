## Does Life360 Notify When You Log Out On Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G?

Life360 is an excellent family security service provider that notifies family members and loved ones about the user's temporary location with GPS tracking and action alerts. In addition, life360 uses texts and notifications to help circle members keep track of everyone's location, driving habits, and frequently visited places.

### **Step 3: Spoof your Android's location**

That's it! Whenever you wish to change the location of your device, simply launch VPNa Fake GPS APK. You can enter any location's address or coordinates in the search bar and wait for it to be loaded on the interface.

![spoof your android](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/vpna/vpna-fake-gps-5.jpg)

Later, you can move the pin around and drop it anywhere you like. Tap on the Start button and confirm your choice to spoof your device's location.

## Part 3: Bonus Tip: How to Spoof an iPhone Location without Jailbreak

While Android users can take the assistance of VPNa Fake GPS, iOS users often find it hard to change their device location. Well, in this case, you can consider [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) . It is a user-friendly application that can spoof your iPhone location to any other place by entering its address or exact coordinates. Besides that, you can also simulate the movement of your device between different spots.

### Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the tool

At first, you can just connect your iPhone to your computer and launch the Dr.Fone toolkit. Select the "Virtual Location" feature from its home and click on the "Get Started" button.
