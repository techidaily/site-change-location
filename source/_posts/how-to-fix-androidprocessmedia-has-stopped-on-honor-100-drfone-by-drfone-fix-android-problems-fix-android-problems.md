With a full backup of your Honor 100, you can now embark on a mission to fix the error. There are several methods to clear this error. We have outlined three of the most effective solutions here.

### Method 1: Ensure app and system updates

Step 2: In "Settings," go to "System" > "Software Update" to check for system updates.

### Method 2: Reset app preferences

App preference settings might sometimes lead to conflicts or anomalies. Resetting these settings can revert apps to their default state, resolving potential issues.

Step 1: Go to "Settings" on your device.

Step 2: Access "Apps."

Step 3: Tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner and select "Reset App Preferences."

### Method 3: Clear the cache and data on your device

Step 1: Go to Settings> Applications> Manage Applications and find the Google Services framework.

Step 2: Next, find Google Play from the same Manage Applications page.

Step 3: Tap on it and then Tap on clear cache.

Step 4: Press the back button to go back to the Google Services framework and then choose Force stop > clear cache > OK

Step 5: Next you need to open Google Play and when presented with an error, click OK

Step 6: Turn off the Honor 100 device and then turn it back on. Go to the Google Services framework again and turn it on to see if the issue has been resolved.

### Method 4: Check Google Sync & Media Storage settings

Step 1: Go to Settings > Accounts and Personal> Google Sync and uncheck all the checkboxes to stop the Google Synchronization.

Step 2: Disable and Clear all Media Storage data by going to Settings> Apps> All Apps. Find the Media Storage> Clear Data> Disable

Step 3: Use the same method as above to clear the Download Manager data

Step 4: Turn off your device and then turn it on

This Should clear the error message for good.

### Method 5: Boot your device into safe mode

[Safe mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html) can temporarily disable third-party apps, allowing only core system apps. This detects if a third-party app causes the "Android process media keeps stopping" error. If the problem disappears in safe mode, a third-party app might be the cause. Uninstalling it can restore normal function. If the problem persists in safe mode, a deeper system issue might exist, needing further investigation or support.

## How to Fix It: Honor 100 Won't Turn On

Did your Honor 100 decide to go on vacation and refuses to turn on? If your Honor 100 won’t turn on for no apparent reason, finding why it failed to power on and the solution for it is not a fun process.

Here, we hope we are able to give you a checklist of reasons behind this issue and the possible steps you can take to rectify it.

## Part 1: Common Reasons That Your Honor 100 Won't Turn On

If you cannot find any reason why your Honor 100 will not switch on, here are some possible reasons:

1. Your Android phone is simply frozen in power-off or sleep mode. In which case, it fails to switch itself on or wake itself up when you initiate it.
2. Your phone’s battery may be out of charge.
3. The operating system or installed software is corrupted. The tell-tale sign if this is that if you manage to switch on your Honor 100, it freezes or crash soon after.
4. Your device is clogged up with dust and lint causing the hardware to not work properly.
5. [Your power button is broken](https://www.wondershare.com/reset-android/restart-android-without-power-button.html), which caused it to not be able to trigger the necessary action needed to power up the Android phone. Check to also see if your connectors have no carbon build-up which will cause your phone to not be charged properly.
