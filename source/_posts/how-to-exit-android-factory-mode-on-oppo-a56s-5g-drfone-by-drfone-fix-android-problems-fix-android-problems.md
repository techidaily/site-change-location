## How to Exit Android Factory Mode On Oppo A56s 5G?

You’ve often heard that recovery mode will solve just about any problem your Oppo A56s 5G is experiencing. This is mostly true and one of the components of Android’s recovery mode, factory mode or [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/wipe-data-factory-reset.html) is one of the most efficient ways to solve various problems on your device. While factory mode is often a good thing, there are times when your device can enter factory mode on its own. Other times, you can safely enter factory mode but not know how to get out.

Fortunately for you, this article will explain all aspects of factory mode and especially how to safely exit factory mode.

## Part 1. What is Android Factory Mode?

Factory mode or what is commonly known as factory reset is one of the options available for you when your Oppo A56s 5G is in recovery mode. Several options are available for you once you enter Recovery mode on your device but few are as effective as the wipe data/ factory reset option. This option is useful in solving a whole host of problems that your device could be experiencing.

If you have been using your Oppo A56s 5G for a while now and its performance to be less than ideal, a factory reset might be a good solution. That is however not the only problem a factory reset or factory mode can solve. It will also work for a number or Android errors that you may experience, problems caused by faulty firmware updates and also tweaks made on your device that may not have worked as expected.

It is however important to note that a factory reset or factory mode does often result in the loss of all your data. Therefore a backup is necessary to protect against this data loss risk.

## Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan

Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Oppo A56s 5Gs because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Oppo A56s 5G is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.

## Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot

Sometimes, people complain that Oppo A56s 5G is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.

When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.

## Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App

In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.

Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.

![android not receiving texts clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg)

Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Oppo A56s 5G device free up the memory of your device.

Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.

## Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space

Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Oppo A56s 5G, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.

Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.

![android not receiving texts - free up space](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg)
