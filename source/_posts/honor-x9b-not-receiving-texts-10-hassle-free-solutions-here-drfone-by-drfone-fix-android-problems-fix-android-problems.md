It won’t take long, and your Honor X9b will be repaired. Now you will be able to receive and send text messages without any hassle.

## Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM

The easiest thing that you can try if your Honor X9b is not receiving any text messages is because the SIM is not inserted right. If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can't receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 3: Check Network Connection

Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Honor X9b phone is to check your network connection. Usually, you can see the bar on the top of the screen. Maybe the problem exists because you have no signal strength at the moment.

![android not receiving texts - check connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/no-internet-connection.jpg)

## Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan

Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Honor X9bs because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Honor X9b is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.

## Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot

Sometimes, people complain that Honor X9b is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.

When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.

## Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App

In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.

Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![android not receiving texts clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg)

Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Honor X9b device free up the memory of your device.

Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.

## Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space

Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Honor X9b, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.

Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.

![android not receiving texts - free up space](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg)

Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM. You can either delete all the messages or perform a selective deletion to free up space.

## Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App

If you can’t receive messages on your default app, then you can try installing a third-party messaging app. Nowadays, most people use social media messaging apps like WhatsApp, Skype, etc. for messaging. So, if somehow, the Android is not receiving texts, then the new apps can help you to send and receive messages with a non-native network.

## Part 9: Ensure your Phone is Fully Charged

Another possible fix to this problem might be your phone’s battery percentage. Sometimes, when the Android is in power saving mode, it disables the default apps too. As a result, you can't even receive text messages on Android. So, when you plug in the charger, the power saving mode will be disabled, and you will get your text messages.

## Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone

If the Honor X9b phone is not receiving texts from iPhone, then this might be a different issue. Usually, there is an option on the iPhone where they can send texts as iMessage and simple messages. If the iPhone user sends the text as iMessage, then it will not show up on the Android device. To resolve this, you have to follow the steps below:

Taking the iPhone in hand makes sure that you are connected to a network. Open settings and scroll to look for the Message option. Toggle the bar next to the iMessage option to turn it off.

![android not receiving texts - check iphone message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/deactivate-imessages.jpg)

If the FaceTime option is also on, you might have to deactivate that too to send messages and calls as regular ones.

## App Won't Open on Your Honor X9b? Here Are All Fixes

It is not a very rare phenomenon where an App won't open, crash abruptly or face trouble while launching on an Android device. Many Android phone users also add to the fact that whenever they try to launch an App, it keeps loading but does not run smoothly, as it should in normal circumstances.

In such a scenario it is obvious for Android Smartphone users to look for possible solutions for such a random error so that their App/Apps load and work normally.

Many people are also interested in knowing about the causes behind why an App won't open or why multiple/all Apps won’t open. This article will answer your query about why won't my App open on an Android phone by listing a few probable causes for the problem.

Here are all the fixes you need if an App won’t open on your Honor X9b. Read on to find out all about why Apps won't open on your Honor X9b and solutions to overcome such a problem.

## Part 1: Possible reasons for Apps won't open

If you are an Android phone user and face a problem while trying to open an App on your device, you will ask yourself “Why won't my App open?”. To answer your question and explain to you why an App won't open on your phone, here are some probable and simple reasons to make you understand the real problem.

It is appropriate to tag our generation as smartphone addicts because we use smartphones for anything and everything. All our important information, such as photos, videos, audio files, documents, notes, calendars, emails, etc, are stored on our phones. This causes a major storage/space problem in our phones and **a shortage of storage space** is one of the main reasons why an App won’t open or why all Apps won't open on your Honor X9b. To see how much of your storage space is occupied by Apps, go to “Settings” and select “Application Manager”.

![Application Manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984182929893.jpg)

![Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984583143306.jpg)

Another possible reason for Apps to crash or why an App won't open is a possible data crash. This may occur due to **an unstable internet connection** or **various other background software interruptions**.

The causes for the problem to occur are many and no specific reason can be established as the only reason why Apps won't open on your Honor X9b. There are a lot of speculations about why such a problem occurs and persists, but it is more important to focus on how to fix if a particular App won't open or if all Apps won't open on Android.

In this segment, we will discuss the three best ways to help you fix the problem if only a particular App won't open/launch/ run and takes an indefinite time to load.

1\. Update the App

It is always advisable to keep your Android software as well as your Apps up-to-date and you must constantly check for any updates which may be available in the Google Play Store.

Follow the steps given below to update the app which won't open on your phone:

• Visit Google Play Store on your Honor X9b.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

![select “My Apps & Games](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183627979.jpg)

• In this step, you may click on “Update All” to update all Apps for which an update is available or manually select the Apps which you wish to Update.

![Update All](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183782889.jpg)

Once the App is updated, close all Apps and tabs running in the background. Now try to launch the app once again. If it opens, your problem is solved. If not, DO NOT worry as there are more ways to help you.

2\. Force Stop the App

Closing the App completely which won't open on your phone is a good idea. To make sure that no operations are running in the background related to the App, you must “Force Stop” it. Doing this is extremely simple and all you need to do is follow the steps given herein under:

• Visit “Settings” on your phone.

• Click on “Apps” to see a list of all the Apps on your Honor X9b.

## Part 4: 3 Common fix if all Apps won’t open on Android

In this segment, we will discuss solutions to the problem if all your Apps won't open. They are simple and easy to follow and solve the error in no time.

1\. Android updates

Firstly, it is very important to keep your Android software updated at all times as an old Android version might not support new Apps or updated Apps.

To update your software:

• Visit “Settings” and keep going downwards.

• Now select “About Phone”.

• From the options available on the screen, tap on “System Updates"

![tap on “System Updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184697337.jpg)

• In this step, if you are prompted for an update, follow the instruction given and do so.

Updating your Android software solves most of your problems. This method might sound weird but works wonders when it comes to App related issues.

2\. Restart the phone

Restarting your Honor X9b to fix an error might sound old school but it gives good results when your Apps won't open. Restarting your phone is fairly simple. All you need to do is:

• Long press the power button.

• Now click on “Restart”.

![click on “Restart”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184913200.jpg)

Your phone will automatically restart and once it does, you can try to launch the App. You may also restart your Honor X9b by pressing the power button for about 15-20 seconds.

3\. Reset Factory Settings

This method is a little tedious and must be last on your list. Also, make sure you take a backup of all your data and contents stored on your Honor X9b and this solution will completely wipe off your phone making as good as a new smartphone.

To Factory Reset your Honor X9b, carefully follow the guidelines given below:

• Visit “Settings” to find the “Backup and reset” option as shown in the screenshot below.
