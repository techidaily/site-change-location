## Part 4: Fake GPS Location Spoofer User Reviews

To clarify the credibility of the **Fake GPS Location Spoofer app**, we also took our time to check what other users are saying.

Here, we've summarized some of the top reviews from real users on Playstore.

| **Platform** | **User** | **Remarks** | **Rating** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Google Play Store | A Google User | _The company updates the app, in their own words, fixes the bug, and then expects you to pay again and again and again. Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with "routes' ' or "joystick" added. I wouldn't mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn't. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn't working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn't have import & export or a joystick. Import & export wouldn't be important if reliable._ | 1.0/5.0 |
| Google Play Store | Douglas Buell | _This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the "no ads' ' mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I'm immediately shown an ad the instant I've clicked the message "Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!" Why include a feature that doesn't work? To force us to watch an ad you didn't have to work for? Ridiculous._ | 1.0/5.0 |
| Google Play Store | A Google User | _Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It's not difficult, but My OnePlus Nord 3 5G keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won't be using google maps, set it up there, and you're all set. Follow the instructions step by step, and it works._ | 4.0/5.0 |

[![avatar](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

In this time of modern technology, it is hard to be away from your phone or even leave it at home. When any task that we plan to do, usually already have an application released for the sole purpose of doing that task and needing to do it on your phone. When we message our friends, have a video call with our family, or just simply order food to eat at home, you can do all of them on the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device in your palm.

Another advantage of having our phones with us all the time is that you can also see the current location of either your friend or family. For Apple phone users, they have an app that is called "Find My Friends" that will show you the locations of the people that you are tracking. But what if you cannot find the location of the friend? We will find out the causes as to why no location can be found and how you can fix this in just a few simple steps.

## Part 1: Why does an OnePlus Nord 3 5G say "no location found"?

When you are searching for your friend's current location and it shows that "no location found", there could be numerous reasons as to why that is happening. We have listed down the possible reasons why there is no location found.

![no location found](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/find-my-friends-no-location-found-1.jpg)

**_Option #1:_** Your friend has not signed in to the "Find My Friends" application. Make sure that they are registered in the application before tracking their location.

_**Option #2:**_ The other person's mobile is not connected to the internet or their phone is off. This could also be another common reason why you cannot see their location.

_**Option #3:**_ Make sure that their "Location Services" is turned on. Some users would turn this feature off which hinders the application from checking their current location.

_**Option #4:**_ The other user must have set up the wrong date and time. If the date and time do not correspond to the global time, then it will cause problems and difficulty with tracking that user.

**_Option #5:_** The application might not have been enabled under "Location Services". Make sure that the application has the permission to track your current location and you can do this by following the steps below.

![no location found](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/find-my-friends-no-location-found-2.jpg)

- _**Step 1:**_ Go to "Settings" and then "Privacy".
- _**Step 2:**_ You can then go to "Location Services" and make sure that the application "Find My Friends" is enabled to track your location.
