## Part IV: FAQs

Here are some commonly asked questions to help you with location spoofer Tecno Pop 7 Pro apps.

### FAQ 1: Will a location spoofer Tecno Pop 7 Pro app damage my Tecno Pop 7 Pro or its GPS?

Not in the least. Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer on Tecno Pop 7 Pro works from the computer and does not affect either the Tecno Pop 7 Pro or the GPS chip inside the Tecno Pop 7 Pro. So when you want to come back to your real location, all you need to do is restart the Tecno Pop 7 Pro.

### FAQ 2: Do I need to jailbreak to use a location spoofer Tecno Pop 7 Pro app?

Can't say for other apps in the market, but Wondershare Dr.Fone – Virtual Location does not require you to jailbreak your Tecno Pop 7 Pro. It works using the computer to temporarily change the GPS coordinates of your Tecno Pop 7 Pro, and you can stop spoofing your location anytime by simply restarting your handset. It does not cause security issues with iOS or risk your privacy at all.

### FAQ 3: Can I jailbreak Tecno Pop 7 Pro to spoof location using Cydia?

The jailbreakers are only catching up to iOS 15 right now. It is being reported that they are close to jailbreaking iOS 15. As you are running iOS 16, you cannot jailbreak Tecno Pop 7 Pro to spoof location using Cydia. Furthermore, jailbreaking is not recommended in today's age given the security and privacy risks it poses.

### Conclusion

Location spoofer Tecno Pop 7 Pro apps are gaining prevalence today mostly among gamers who use these GPS spoofer Tecno Pop 7 Pro apps to catch more Pokémon. However, anyone can use a location changer on Tecno Pop 7 Pro for several other benefits such as breaking the geo-restrictions in dating apps and streaming websites to find dates outside your city limits for free and accessing a catalog of movies and TV shows that is not available in your region due to licensing or other considerations. There are several Tecno Pop 7 Pro location spoofer apps in the market, each extolling its virtues. None of them, however, come close to Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) spoofer on Tecno Pop 7 Pro given its intuitive interface and ease of use. Not only can you use it on iOS 16 without problem as this app works from a computer, but you also do not have to think about security issues that jailbreaking a device brings because Dr.Fone Virtual Location changer on Tecno Pop 7 Pro works without jailbreaking the Tecno Pop 7 Pro.
