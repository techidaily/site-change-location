**Method 3: Take advantage of anti-spyware software**

Another way to stop your spouse from spying on you is by using anti-spy software. Just like spy software sends your location and other information to the hacking spouse, an anti-spyware tool will prevent tracking your device and will prevent from sharing your device information like calls, messages, and others. There are several anti-spyware tools for Android and iOS available in the market and some of the popular ones are Mobile Security & Anti-Theft Protection, iAmNotified, Avira Mobile Security, Cell Spy Catcher, Lookout, and more.

### Response 3: Seek a Divorce

Spying on your spouse is not only illegal but also unethical. So, if you feel that your trust has been shattered by your spouse by keeping an eye on your phone and your activities and staying with him/her does not seem to be possible, seek a divorce. It's better to come out of a relationship, instead of staying the one where there is no trust or respect.

## Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Messenger’s Live Location

Facebook is well aware that sharing location details is essential to its users. That’s why developers have come up with a brilliant idea and rolled out Live Location on Messenger. It basically works like other location-sharing features. However, Live Location provides more precise and thorough location information. It’s in map form, where you can view the exact location and track the movements of the sender. You’ll continue to see updates for as long as the sharing is not halted on the other end. To navigate it properly, try to read tutorials on how to share Live Location on Messenger.

![facebook messenger live location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-1.jpg)

What if you wish to send a particular address from another location? There is no problem with that. Messenger allows users to search for a specific place, trace it on the map, and share the details. The receiver can view it in map form and get directions if necessary. See? It’s very easy and convenient. No need to type in long addresses just to share a particular location with your friend. You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.

Convenience is just one thing. Messenger’s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users. One of which is the accuracy of the shared location information. Since the details are automatically generated through GPS, you can be sure that it is correct and definite. If you go out and track it down the neighborhood, you can certainly find the location in no time. Just make sure that the location services on your smartphone are activated so you can view your progress in real time. Also, stay vigilant while you’re out and keep yourself safe from any harm. Remember that safety remains a priority and comes above convenience.

There’s no denying that the location-sharing feature of Facebook Messenger is useful to many of us. It always comes in very handy whenever we need to meet people somewhere or invite them to our places. However, we should not become too complacent and let our guard down. Sharing sensitive information like whereabouts always comes with risk, regardless of the platform and the intention. Therefore, make it a habit to protect your privacy at all costs. In this regard, Wondershare Dr.Fone has something special to offer. Its Virtual Location feature, capable of modifying and simulating your location records, can be of great help for you. Don’t worry. It’s very easy to use. Here’s a short guide for you.



- **Step 1:** Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its [<u>official website.</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) Right after, install it on your computer.
- **Step 2:** Launch the newly installed software on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your smartphone using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions and perform the steps accordingly to ensure the connection between the two devices is stable enough to handle the succeeding operations.
- **Step 3:** Navigate to the left-side panel and then click **Toolbox.** On the main dashboard, click **Virtual Location.** Is it your first time using this feature? If so, allow Wondershare Dr.Fone to download additional resources. Don’t sweat it. It will only take a few minutes to complete.
- **Step 4:** Once the downloading process has concluded, Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location will automatically open on a separate window. From there, go to the top-right menu bar and then click **Teleport Mode.** It is the first icon that appears in the row.
