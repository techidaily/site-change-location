When any task that we plan to do, usually already have an application released for the sole purpose of doing that task and needing to do it on your phone. When we message our friends, have a video call with our family, or just simply order food to eat at home, you can do all of them on the HTC U23 device in your palm.

Another advantage of having our phones with us all the time is that you can also see the current location of either your friend or family.
