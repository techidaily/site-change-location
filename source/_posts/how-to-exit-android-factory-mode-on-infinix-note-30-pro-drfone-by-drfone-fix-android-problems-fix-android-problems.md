## How to Exit Android Factory Mode On Infinix Note 30 Pro?

You’ve often heard that recovery mode will solve just about any problem your Infinix Note 30 Pro is experiencing. This is mostly true and one of the components of Android’s recovery mode, factory mode or [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/wipe-data-factory-reset.html) is one of the most efficient ways to solve various problems on your device.

It is however important to note that a factory reset or factory mode does often result in the loss of all your data. Therefore a backup is necessary to protect against this data loss risk.

## Part 1: Clear the cache of Settings and Google Play Service

It is possible that the corrupted cache files are responsible for this error. Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:

1. Open “Settings” on your Infinix Note 30 Pro and choose “Apps & Notifications”/”Apps”/”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).
2. In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.
3. Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.

![settings crashing - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg)

Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”. Therefore, go accordingly without getting confused.

## Part 2: Clear the Android phone’s RAM and retry

As the next tip, we would like to suggest you clear your device’s RAM by ceasing the running apps in the background.

1. Firstly, you need to go to the Recent apps screen. For this, long-press the Home key.  
    Note: Please note that different devices have different ways to go to the Recent apps screen. Do it according to the Infinix Note 30 Pro device you own.
2. Now, swipe the apps and tap on the clear option. You will be able to notice the amount of RAM cleared

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Outdated Operating System Firmware

One of the primary culprits behind the compatibility error is [<u>outdated OS firmware</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html). App developers release updates to keep up with the latest features and security patches.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Insufficient Hardware Requirements

Each application has specific hardware prerequisites that your device needs to fulfill. In case your smartphone does not meet the required specifications, you won't be able to utilize the app. Thus, Google Play Store may restrict access to certain applications, citing compatibility issues.

### 3\. Corrupted Cache Files

Cache files are designed to enhance the speed and efficiency of app loading. Yet, they can sometimes become corrupt. When this occurs, it disrupts the app's normal operation. Clearing these corrupted cache files is often a crucial step.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Geographic Restrictions

In certain cases, app developers or Google Play itself may impose geographic restrictions. This could lead to compatibility issues if your device is located in an area where the app is restricted. Understanding the geographical availability of an app is vital in finding the root cause.

### 4\. Beta Versions and Unstable Releases

Engaging with beta versions or unstable releases of an app can result in compatibility issues. These versions are typically in the testing phase. That's why their compatibility with a wide range of devices may not be guaranteed. If you find yourself facing compatibility errors, it's worth checking if you are in a beta program.
