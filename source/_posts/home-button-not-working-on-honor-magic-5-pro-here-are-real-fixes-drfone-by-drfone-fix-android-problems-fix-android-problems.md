## Part 1: Top Causes of an Unresponsive Touchscreen

Android has been the best-selling OS since 2011, with over three billion active users. With the release of Android 13, complaints over **touch issues** on certain Android phones have popped up over the internet. Meanwhile, software updates over the years can sometimes make their **phones stuck on the loading screen,** causing worry among Android users.

Here are some of the top causes why your **phone screen stopped working,** mainly for Android.

- **Physical Damage**

If your Android **phone is not responding to touch,** it can be due to a cracked LCD causing temperature variants or magnetic fields to malfunction on your Honor Magic 5 Pro.

![cracked screen iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-02.jpg)

For iOS users, your iPhone will temporarily stop working if it detects extreme temperatures such as a too-hot or too-cold reading. You should turn off your iPhone and let it cool down or warm to a normal temperature.

- **Faulty Applications**

Certain apps can sometimes make your phone experience **touch issues**. Your Android screen may work everywhere except a particular app. In this case, the fault is likely on the app, not your smartphone. It’s recommended to download the latest apps with frequent software updates to prevent malicious apps from corrupting or crashing your phone.

- **iOS/Android Software Issues**

Your **phone screen not responding** can also be due to software glitches that your smartphone picks up during regular use. Your iOS/Android device will sometimes freeze or hang if you run too many intensive apps simultaneously. The situation can lead to **touch issues** when using the phone.

- **Dirty Screen or Bad Peripherals**

It may not respond properly when an Android device is dirty due to water, sweat, or body oils. It will not be able to take inputs, causing your **phone to not respond to touch**. A poor screen protector and a tightly pressed phone case will also negatively impact your smartphone.

## Part 2: What To Do When Your Smartphone Is Not Responding to Touch

Here is a list of things you should do **how to fix a frozen phone touch screen,** whether you’re using an iPhone or an Android smartphone.

### 1\. Clean Your Smartphone

Your **screen touch not working** can sometimes get fixed by simply cleaning the screen on your smartphone. Use a soft dry cloth, gently clean your iPhone or Android device, and ensure water, oils, dirt, or other debris are no longer on your display. If you recently dropped your device in water, turn it off and leave it untouched for the next few hours.

![cleaning iphone with cloth](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-04.jpg)

### 2\. Remove Extra Peripherals

Unplug any external device connected to your iPhone’s Lightning port or USB-C if your **phone screen stops working**. For Android users, meanwhile, disconnect any accessories like chargers or wireless headphones. After that, try using the touchscreen. If it works, the outcome proves that the fault appeared due to the external device.
