## How to Exit Android Factory Mode On Realme GT 5 Pro?

You’ve often heard that recovery mode will solve just about any problem your Realme GT 5 Pro is experiencing. This is mostly true and one of the components of Android’s recovery mode, factory mode or [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/wipe-data-factory-reset.html) is one of the most efficient ways to solve various problems on your device. While factory mode is often a good thing, there are times when your device can enter factory mode on its own. Other times, you can safely enter factory mode but not know how to get out.
