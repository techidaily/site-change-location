## Part 1. Causes of Bricked Phones

In everyday settings, our mobile devices have become our greatest friends, therefore breaking your phone is the last thing you want to do. There are different reasons why devices brick, and we must be familiar with them in order to comprehend the various techniques to repair bricked devices.

Here are some common reasons why your Xiaomi Redmi 12 is bricked:

- **Flashing Stock/Custom ROM:**It is possible that you installed an incompatible ROM in the Android phone, that the phone shuts off during the process, or that you have performed other errors that cause your phone to restart indefinitely or to become stuck at the starting screen.
- **Rooting an Android device:**You are unable to effectively root the Xiaomi Redmi 12 device.
- **Android firmware is being updated:**If the phone is interrupted when updating the Android firmware, it will be bricked.
- **Installing harmful applications:**You installed harmful programs on your Xiaomi Redmi 12, or the phone was infected with a virus.

## Part 2. How to Fix a Bricked Phone

The first step is to establish how badly your device is bricked. In most cases, you will be working with soft bricks that are pretty simple to repair. If your phone is stuck in a boot loop or enters recovery mode every time you turn it on, you may have a soft brick.

To repair bricked Android phones and tablets, you must first thoroughly examine the Xiaomi Redmi 12 device's state. Before you begin troubleshooting, determine the sort of bricking that your phone is experiencing. However, there is no specific software to unbrick your Xiaomi Redmi 12; you may need to learn the complexities of this issue or hire a professional to do it for you.

- **Step 2:** Select the highlighted option by pressing the **Power button**. After that, wait for your device to reset normally.
- **Note:** The steps for booting into recovery mode may change based on the manufacturer of your device. For further information, go to the user manual for your phone or tablet.

### Method 2. Wipe the Cache Partition

This is the first indication that a user's phone has gone bricked. The phone turned on automatically, however it became stuck or frozen on the logo screen. The issue might be caused by the undeleting of data and cache, which prevents the phone from displaying the home screen.

- **Step 3:** Finally, on your smartphone, choose the Reboot system immediately.

### Method 3. Perform a Factory Reset

A factory reset can undo the alterations made to your device that resulted in the brick phone, but you will lose everything you have downloaded and installed in the process. Here's how to restore a bricked Android phone to factory settings:

- **Step 1:** Boot your device into recovery mode (turn off your device, then press **power** button + **volume up** button).
- **Step 2:** Select “**Wipe Data/“Factory Reset”** then confirm the action. When the process is done, you'll be returned to the recovery mode menu.

- **Step 2:** Click the **“Install zip from sdcard”** button. Then, select the ZIP file that contains the ROM. Finally, click the **"reboot system now"** button.

## Part 3. How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone

How to prevent a device from “bricking” itself and how to repair it if it does The delay is set by the MCU, but it should be long enough to allow the debug adapter to connect to the Xiaomi Redmi 12 device and halt it before the Xiaomi Redmi 12 device disables itself.

Here are some things to remember to prevent your device from bricking:

- **Avoiding unofficial firmware updates:** Installing unapproved OS firmware on your phone will most certainly violate any manufacturer's warranty you have on it. Read the installation instructions for your unique phone model thoroughly and then carefully follow them, taking time and patience.
- **Being cautious when rooting or jail breaking:**Rooting and Jail breaking disables parts of the operating system's built-in security mechanisms, which are part of what makes the operating system safe, and your data protected from exposure or damage.
- **Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.
- **Backup your phone data regularly:** Backing up your phone safeguards your data in the event that you lose it, it is stolen, or it no longer works. When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.
- **Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:** Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.
