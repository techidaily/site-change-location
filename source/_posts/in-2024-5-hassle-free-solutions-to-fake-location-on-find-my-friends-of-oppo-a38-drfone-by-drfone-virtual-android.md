## Part 3: Bonus Tip: How to Spoof an iPhone Location without Jailbreak

While Android users can take the assistance of VPNa Fake GPS, iOS users often find it hard to change their device location. Well, in this case, you can consider [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) . It is a user-friendly application that can spoof your iPhone location to any other place by entering its address or exact coordinates. Besides that, you can also simulate the movement of your device between different spots.
