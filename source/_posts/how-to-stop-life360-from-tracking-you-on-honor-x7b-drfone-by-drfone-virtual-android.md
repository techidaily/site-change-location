The joystick, like one-stop route or multi-stop route modes, aims to facilitate GPS movement on the map. But what's better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.

- **Automatic GPS movement:** Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts. Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.
- **Manual GPS movement:** Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard. Reverse by constantly clicking the Down arrow, or long-pressing the key S or Down on the keyboard. You can also tweak the directions using the four ways above before moving forward or reverse.

Though battery drain can alone not be a sign of the phone being hacked as with time the life of the battery starts decreasing. Still, it can be one of the signs as the hacking apps and tools are resource-draining which in turn decreases the battery life.

### 3\. High data usage

Since the spyware sends a lot of the Honor X7b device information to the hacker using the internet connection, the phone will experience high usage of data.

- Google Maps or Find My iPhone: When the location sharing option is turned on the victim device, the hacking spouse can track the location easily.
- Google account or iCloud data: If your spouse knows the password of your iCloud or Google account, they will easily have access to all the data that is backed up on iCloud. Further, the data can also be used for cloning your device and getting access to personal information.

### 2\. Tracking apps

These are the legitimate apps that can be downloaded from the App store on your phone. Though these tracking apps are mainly used by parents for monitoring their children, a lot of spouses use them for tracking and spying on their partners as well.
