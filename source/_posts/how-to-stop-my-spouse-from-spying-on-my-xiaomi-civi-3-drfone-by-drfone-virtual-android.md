### Method 1: Invest in a Burner Phone

Using an anonymous burner phone purchased with cash is a standard plot device in espionage movies and programs. There is a method that is the same as this for faking Life360.

**Step 1.** Your existing log-in information will work just as well when installing Life360 on your backup phone.

**Step 2.** When you arrive at your destination, connect your burner phone to the Wi-Fi network.

**Step 3.** Don't use Life360 anymore on your phone.

![ invest in a burner phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-your-location-1.jpg)

Turning down the Xiaomi Civi 3 device's potential to interact with Wi-Fi and cellular networks is another option for generating a false location.

**Step 1.** To prevent applications from renewing themselves in the background, you must use the option that saves battery life.
