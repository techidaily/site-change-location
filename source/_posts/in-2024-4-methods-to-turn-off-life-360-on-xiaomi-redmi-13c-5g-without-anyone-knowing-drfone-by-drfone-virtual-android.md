Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch.

## Part 3: One-stop Tool to Change GPS Location on iOS and Android

Although VPNs provide a great way to **change** **YouTube** **TV** **location** through IP address, it still lacks accuracy with the location.
