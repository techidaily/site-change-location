## Conclusion

You can fix the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error on Android in different ways. But it depends on the cause of the error. If an app is causing the error, you can try two things. First, remove the app’s screenshot restriction. Second, download a different screenshot app or a different device to take screenshots.

Although there are ways to bypass the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error message, it’s crucial to know why screenshots are not allowed. Many apps and websites do not permit it to protect sensitive information, prevent piracy, and follow regulations. They also do it to prevent fraud, protect user privacy, and safeguard intellectual property.

If you think the issue is with your Android system, or your device becomes bricked after trying other methods, experiencing app crashes, or otherwise malfunctioning, try using the Dr.Fone System Repair tool. It is worth trying and can fix most Android system issues in a few minutes.

In everyday settings, our mobile devices have become our greatest friends, therefore breaking your phone is the last thing you want to do. There are different reasons why devices brick, and we must be familiar with them in order to comprehend the various techniques to repair bricked devices.

Here are some common reasons why your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is bricked:

- **Flashing Stock/Custom ROM:**It is possible that you installed an incompatible ROM in the Android phone, that the phone shuts off during the process, or that you have performed other errors that cause your phone to restart indefinitely or to become stuck at the starting screen.
- **Rooting an Android device:**You are unable to effectively root the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device.
- **Android firmware is being updated:**If the phone is interrupted when updating the Android firmware, it will be bricked.
- **Installing harmful applications:**You installed harmful programs on your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, or the phone was infected with a virus.

## Part 2. How to Fix a Bricked Phone

The first step is to establish how badly your device is bricked. In most cases, you will be working with soft bricks that are pretty simple to repair. If your phone is stuck in a boot loop or enters recovery mode every time you turn it on, you may have a soft brick.

To repair bricked Android phones and tablets, you must first thoroughly examine the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device's state. Before you begin troubleshooting, determine the sort of bricking that your phone is experiencing. However, there is no specific software to unbrick your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra; you may need to learn the complexities of this issue or hire a professional to do it for you.

Here are some simple methods for repairing bricked Android devices:

### Method 1. Reboot the Phone in Safe Mode

Trying to reboot your android device in safe mode is the first and easiest thing you should try if your phone is bricked. Here's how to do it:

- **Step 1:** Turn off your smartphone and press the **Volume Up** + **Power** button to enter recovery mode. Then, using the volume controls, navigate the menu and select Reboot system now.

![android safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/Bricked-Android-Phone-1.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Select the highlighted option by pressing the **Power button**. After that, wait for your device to reset normally.
- **Note:** The steps for booting into recovery mode may change based on the manufacturer of your device. For further information, go to the user manual for your phone or tablet.

### Method 2. Wipe the Cache Partition

This is the first indication that a user's phone has gone bricked. The phone turned on automatically, however it became stuck or frozen on the logo screen. The issue might be caused by the undeleting of data and cache, which prevents the phone from displaying the home screen.

This issue, however, may be resolved by wiping the data and cache partitions in recovery mode. You must do the following to do this:

- **Step 1:** Turn off your smartphone and enter recovery mode by pressing the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously. Different devices have various approaches for entering recovery mode, so you may perform better.
- **Step 2:** After entering recovery mode, you should see the screen below. Remember to pick Advanced and then “Wipe Dalvik Cache” if your device is under Clockwork Mod recovery. Return to the main screen and select “Wipe Cache Partition” once more.

- **Step 3:** Finally, on your smartphone, choose the Reboot system immediately.

### Method 3. Perform a Factory Reset

- **Step 1:** Boot your device into recovery mode (turn off your device, then press **power** button + **volume up** button).
- **Step 2:** Select “**Wipe Data/“Factory Reset”** then confirm the action. When the process is done, you'll be returned to the recovery mode menu.

If you boot your phone directly into recovery mode, there's a problem with the ROM you loaded. Then simply flash the following custom ROM on your phone:

- **Step 1:** Save the required ROM (in ZIP format) to an SD card. The SD card should then be inserted into your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.
- **Step 2:** Click the **“Install zip from sdcard”** button. Then, select the ZIP file that contains the ROM. Finally, click the **"reboot system now"** button.

## Part 3. How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone

How to prevent a device from “bricking” itself and how to repair it if it does The delay is set by the MCU, but it should be long enough to allow the debug adapter to connect to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device and halt it before the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device disables itself.

When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.
- **Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:** Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.
