### Part 3: Simulate Route Movement for Multiple Locations

Step 1: For multiple spots, you need to click the “multi-stop route” after entering map interface. This mode is the second icon on the upper right side. Now, select the multiple places one by one where you want to pass.

Step 2: The pop-up will show the distance where you need to hit the “Move Here” button. Choose the moving speed.
