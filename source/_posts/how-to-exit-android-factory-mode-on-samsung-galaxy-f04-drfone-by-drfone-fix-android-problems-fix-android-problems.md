You’ve often heard that recovery mode will solve just about any problem your Samsung Galaxy F04 is experiencing. This is mostly true and one of the components of Android’s recovery mode, factory mode or [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/wipe-data-factory-reset.html) is one of the most efficient ways to solve various problems on your device. While factory mode is often a good thing, there are times when your device can enter factory mode on its own. Other times, you can safely enter factory mode but not know how to get out.

Fortunately for you, this article will explain all aspects of factory mode and especially how to safely exit factory mode.

## Part 1. What is Android Factory Mode?

Factory mode or what is commonly known as factory reset is one of the options available for you when your Samsung Galaxy F04 is in recovery mode.

## Part 1. Why Spotify Keeps Crashing

![spotify crashing problem](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-2.jpg)

Some people have encountered a problem with their Spotify accounts. Spotify can sometimes keep crashing and closing due to several reasons. For example, it can happen due to your phone not being compatible with the app. This can happen if your operating system isn’t updated to the newest version.

Another reason the Spotify app keeps crashing could be an antivirus or a VPN blocking Spotify from working. Moreover, your device might be out of storage space, causing your phone to slow down and crash apps.

Several other reasons for this problem include network issues, a weak Wi-Fi signal, or the battery saving mode. Furthermore, your apps and files might be corrupted, or an app on your phone might block Spotify from working correctly.

- **Step 1:** Open
- **Step 2:** Go to **Device Maintenance > Storage**or go directly to Storage.

![storage in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-16.jpg)

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue. If that’s the case, you can check with your friends if their Spotify is working or check online if Spotify is down. To do that, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.

![spotify server up or down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-21.jpg)
