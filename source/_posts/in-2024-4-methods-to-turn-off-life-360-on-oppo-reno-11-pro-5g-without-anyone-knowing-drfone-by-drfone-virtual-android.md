You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family.

This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

### FAQ 2: Do I need to jailbreak to use a location spoofer Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G app?

Can't say for other apps in the market, but Wondershare Dr.Fone – Virtual Location does not require you to jailbreak your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G. It works using the computer to temporarily change the GPS coordinates of your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G, and you can stop spoofing your location anytime by simply restarting your handset.

### FAQ 3: Can I jailbreak Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G to spoof location using Cydia?

The jailbreakers are only catching up to iOS 15 right now. It is being reported that they are close to jailbreaking iOS 15. As you are running iOS 16, you cannot jailbreak Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G to spoof location using Cydia.
