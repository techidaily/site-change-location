## How to Use Life360 on Windows PC For Oppo A38?

Life360 is an online platform that utilizes geo-location services to help users share their real-time location with friends and family. The app allows people to create a family group and stay connected to each other through features like chatting, sharing location, sending safety alerts, etc.

As of now, you cannot run **_Life360 on computer_** as it is only available for Android and iOS. _Why?_ Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.

However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the **_Life360 app for Windows_**. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the **_Life360 app on Windows_**.

For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.

In this situation, you can simply run the **_Life360 app on PC_**. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.

Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.

## Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?

Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones. The app is basically designed with a vision to keep family members connected and safe. In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.

The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.

However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and **_run the app on a Windows PC_**. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.

### Q2. How to Bypass Hulu Error Codes?

While connecting Hulu using a VPN, you may encounter several errors like errors 16, 400, 406, and others with each of them having different issues like connection, account, server, and more. Depending on the type of type and meaning of the error, you can try bypassing and fixing it.

For Hulu errors 3 and 5 that are regarding connection issues, you can try to restart the streaming device and also restart your router. For error 16 that shows invalid region issues, you need to use a VPN that can help you bypass the region blocks of Hulu. Some of the other possible ways to fix different code error issues include reinstalling or updating the Hulu app, checking the internet connection, removing the Oppo A38 device from the account, and adding it again.

### Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?

Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – **Hulu home location**. The home location will apply to all the Oppo A38 devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.

Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.

So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.

![home location error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg)

To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you **remove home location errors**:

**Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router**

Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.

**Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer**

Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.

We usually host a gathering once in a while and invite our friends to come over. Most of us are already used to organizing such activities because we’ve been doing that for a long time now.

You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.

Convenience is just one thing. Messenger’s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users. One of which is the accuracy of the shared location information.

## Part 2. How to Share My Location on Messenger?

How do I share my location on Messenger? As mentioned earlier, it’s very easy to use Facebook Messenger for location sharing. All it takes is just a few clicks on the platform.

Any of them can be of great help to you, depending on your current situation. Do you want to try them now? Check out the tutorials below.

### Method 1: Share location on Facebook Messenger via Live Location

How to share my location on Messenger? Well, the first option you can try is through Live Location. It works best if you wish to tell somebody where exactly you are and give updates from time to time. Don’t worry. Although it looks complicated at a glance, in reality, it’s actually not rocket science. It only takes a few seconds to complete. Below is a tutorial on how to share Live Location on Messenger in easy steps.

### Method 2: Share location on Facebook Messenger via Pinned Location

Let’s say there is a specific place you want to visit with your friend. Is there a way to share the address of the venue without you being there at the moment? Fortunately, it is possible. Apart from sharing your current location in real-time via Live Location, you can also send pinned locations on Messenger. You just need to search for it and then redirect the details to your friend. Yes. It’s just as simple as that. Do you want to try it on your smartphone? If so, follow the guide below.

- **Step 1:** Launch the **Facebook Messenger** application on your mobile device.
- **Step 2:** Scroll through your conversations and find the receiver from the list. Click on it.
- **Step 3:** On the text field, click the **More (+)** icon at the bottom-left corner.
- **Step 4:** Then, click **Location.**
- **Step 5:** Locate the search bar above the interactive map and type in the location you want to share.

![search location on messenger](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-10.jpg)

- **Step 6:** Choose one from the suggested results and then click on it. The details will then be forwarded immediately to the intended receiver.

### Method 3: Share location on Facebook Messenger via Google Maps location

How do I share my location in Messenger if I cannot find it on the map provided? Yes. That happens sometimes. There are certain places that are untraceable on the messaging platform. As a result, it doesn’t appear on the map when you try to search for it. But don’t sweat it. If you experience the same issue, you can instead use Google Maps to share location details. How to do it? Check out the tutorial provided below.

- **Step 1:** Launch the **Google Maps** application on your mobile device.
- **Step 2:** Click on the **Search** bar at the top and then type in the location.
