If you have been using your Honor Magic 5 for a while now and its performance to be less than ideal, a factory reset might be a good solution. That is however not the only problem a factory reset or factory mode can solve. It will also work for a number or Android errors that you may experience, problems caused by faulty firmware updates and also tweaks made on your device that may not have worked as expected.

It is however important to note that a factory reset or factory mode does often result in the loss of all your data. Therefore a backup is necessary to protect against this data loss risk.

## Part 1: Top Causes of an Unresponsive Touchscreen

Android has been the best-selling OS since 2011, with over three billion active users. With the release of Android 13, complaints over **touch issues** on certain Android phones have popped up over the internet. Meanwhile, software updates over the years can sometimes make their **phones stuck on the loading screen,** causing worry among Android users.

Here are some of the top causes why your **phone screen stopped working,** mainly for Android.

- **Physical Damage**

If your Android **phone is not responding to touch,** it can be due to a cracked LCD causing temperature variants or magnetic fields to malfunction on your Honor Magic 5.

![cracked screen iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-02.jpg)

For iOS users, your iPhone will temporarily stop working if it detects extreme temperatures such as a too-hot or too-cold reading. You should turn off your iPhone and let it cool down or warm to a normal temperature.

- **Faulty Applications**

Certain apps can sometimes make your phone experience **touch issues**. Your Android screen may work everywhere except a particular app. In this case, the fault is likely on the app, not your smartphone. It’s recommended to download the latest apps with frequent software updates to prevent malicious apps from corrupting or crashing your phone.

- **iOS/Android Software Issues**

Your **phone screen not responding** can also be due to software glitches that your smartphone picks up during regular use. Your iOS/Android device will sometimes freeze or hang if you run too many intensive apps simultaneously. The situation can lead to **touch issues** when using the phone.

- **Dirty Screen or Bad Peripherals**

It may not respond properly when an Android device is dirty due to water, sweat, or body oils. It will not be able to take inputs, causing your **phone to not respond to touch**. A poor screen protector and a tightly pressed phone case will also negatively impact your smartphone.
