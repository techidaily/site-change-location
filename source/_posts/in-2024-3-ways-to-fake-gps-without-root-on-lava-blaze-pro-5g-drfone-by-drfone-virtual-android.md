## Part 3: One-stop Tool to Change GPS Location on iOS and Android

Although VPNs provide a great way to **change** **YouTube** **TV** **location** through IP address, it still lacks accuracy with the location. To be more precise with region accuracy, [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) changes GPS location to connect your Lava Blaze Pro 5G with a particular area in a specific city.
