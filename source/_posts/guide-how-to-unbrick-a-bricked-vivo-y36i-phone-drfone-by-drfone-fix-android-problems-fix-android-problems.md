## 8 Workable Fixes to the SIM not provisioned MM#2 Error on Vivo Y36i

SIM cards are small chips that act as a connecting medium between your cell phone and your carrier. It is programmed to help your carrier identify your cell phone account with certain information. And eventually, you are enabled to make calls and to make use of mobile internet. Now, if your device is showing “SIM not provisioned” on Android then it signifies that the connection to carrier network cannot be established or perhaps, your carrier isn’t able to identify your cell phone account.


## Part 1. Why does the error “SIM not provisioned MM#2” pop up?

There can be numerous reasons behind the pop up that reads “SIM not provisioned” on Android. But basically, it most probably affects the users who have registered a new SIM card. If you get to experience this issue in other situations or if the SIM is not working in Android, then the problem is with the SIM card and needs to be replaced. Anyways, here is a list of situations when the “SIM not provisioned” error may bother you.

- You got a new SIM card for your new phone.
- You are transferring your contacts into the new SIM card.
- In case, the carrier network provider’s authorization server is unavailable.
- Perhaps, you’re out of the reach of the carrier coverage area and that too, without active roaming agreement.
- Though new SIM cards work flawlessly. But it is often necessary to get your SIM card activated due to security reasons.

Just in case, you haven’t bought any new SIM card and the one you were using was working fine until now, then the most probable reasons behind it could be listed below:

- If your SIM card is too old, possibly it might have gone dead, try replacing it.
- Perhaps, the SIM card was not properly inserted into the slot or there might be some dirt between the SIM and smartphone pins.

A yet another reason could be that your SIM card got deactivated by your carrier provider as it could have been locked to a particular phone. Now, if you insert such a SIM card to another device or a new device even, you may get to witness a message that reads “SIM not valid”.

### 2.2 Ensure the SIM card is not dirty or wet

At times, the issue can be as simple as cleaning your SIM card and SIM slot properly. Ensuring that SIM is not wet either and then putting it back into its place. If this works, then the SIM not working in Android was due to the dirt or moisture that was preventing proper contact between SIM card pins and smartphone circuit.

### 2.3 Insert the SIM card correctly

If your SIM card was working properly until yet, there is a good possibility that the SIM card may have moved a bit from its actual location. Eventually, there is poor contact between the SIM card pins and the circuit. Try inserting your SIM card properly with the following steps.

- Power off your Vivo Y36i and with the help of Q pin, eject the SIM card holder from the SIM slot of your device.
- Now, grab a soft rubber pencil eraser and gently rub it in on the gold pins of SIM card to clean them properly. Then, with the help of a soft cloth wipe away the rubber residue from the SIM card.
- Next, push the SIM back into the SIM card holder properly and push it back into the SIM slot now.
- Turn your device back on and look if your SIM not provisioned on the Android issue is resolved or not.

### 2.6 Try the other SIM card slot

A yet another reason why SIM not working in Android can be because of the SIM card slot might have gone corrupted. Thanks to the dual SIM technology, you do not have to rush immediately to get it to check or repair. You can simply rule out this possibility by ejecting the SIM card from its original SIM slot and then replacing it into the other SIM card slot. If this solution did work out for you then it is obvious that the problem was with the SIM card slot that got corrupted. And hence, it was triggering SIM not responding issue.
