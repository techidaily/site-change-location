## Part 1. Common Reasons Why Infinix Note 30i Phones Get Bricked

- **Trying to flash incompatible ROMs.** Sometimes, people want their Infinix Note 30i phones to run different software like a custom version of Android called a ROM. But if you use the correct ROM for your specific phone, it can mess things up nicely. Also, inexperience with ROM flashing can **hard brick**your **Infinix Note 30i** Be sure to follow guides and ask for community help online.
- **Rooting mishaps/failures.**"Rooting" means giving your phone superpowers, but if you mess up, it can go wrong. Your phone might not boot up, leaving you with a brick. Like the previous bullet, follow guides carefully, especially if inexperienced.
- **Failed Firmware Updates.** When your phone asks you to update its software, following the instructions carefully is essential. If you interrupt the process or something goes wrong, your phone could be bricked.

Now, you must know about soft and hard-bricking to learn how to diagnose your phone. [Soft bricking](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-soft-bricked-android.html) is like a phone's bad day – it might not start up. However, with the right help, you can fix it. Hard bricking is worse. It's when your phone is a paperweight – it won't turn on, respond, or do anything useful.
