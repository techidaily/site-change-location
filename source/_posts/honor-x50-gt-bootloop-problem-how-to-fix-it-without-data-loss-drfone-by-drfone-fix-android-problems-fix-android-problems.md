## Part 4: Boot into Safe Mode to fix Android boot loop

![boot into safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/boot-loop-android.jpg)

Booting your Honor X50 GT into Safe Mode is a useful troubleshooting step to fix boot loop issues caused by third-party apps. When in Safe Mode, the Honor X50 GT device will start up with only essential system apps, and any downloaded apps that might be causing conflicts won't run. Here's how you can boot your Honor X50 GT into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:

**Step 1: Power Off Your Device**

Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.

**Step 2: Access Safe Mode**

To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:

- For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer's logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Honor X50 GT device finishes booting. You should see "Safe Mode" displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.
- Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device's user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.

**Step 3: Observe the Honor X50 GT device**

Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn't occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.

**Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps**

Now that you're in Safe Mode, it's time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.

**Step 5: Restart Normally**

Once you've identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.

By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Honor X50 GT.

## Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue

Factory reset, also known as Hard Reset, is a one-stop solution for all your software resulting in issues. Android boot loop being such problem, can be easily overcome by performing a factory reset.

Please note that all your device’s data and settings will be deleted by adopting this method. However, if you have a Google account signed in on your Honor X50 GT, you will be able to retrieve most of your data once the Honor X50 GT device turns on.

To factory reset your Android boot loop device, you must first boot into the Recovery Mode screen.

Manifested App files are nothing but .apk files which are improvised by you. Such changes may cause the Parse Error to occur more frequently.
