In simple words, you can say that Pokemon Go makes use of mapping technology so as to plot your actual location as you roam around in the streets to catch your favourite Pokemon.

When you play the game, your main goal would be to catch as many Pokemon or fictional characters as you can. Your main task will be to battle your opponents to catch the Pokemon and then train them.

It's worth mentioning here that this AR-game is absolutely convenient to play. Now, one of the most amazing features that have been added to this game is Mega Evolution. But, unfortunately if you were of the opinion that greninja can mega evolve, then you are completely wrong, in fact you should note that no Kalos pokemon can mega evolve.

Through this article, we will discuss all you need to know about Greninja. So, without any further delay, let's get started.
