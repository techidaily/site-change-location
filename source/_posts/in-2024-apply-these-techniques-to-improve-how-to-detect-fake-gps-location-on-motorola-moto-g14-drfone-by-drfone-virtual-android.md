- Using a dedicated GPS simulator and comparing results to expected from provided data.
- Have a security measure to detect GPS spoofing apps installed on a user's smartphone.

While the methods to detect GPS locations are presented above, it's important to remember that detecting fake GPS locations is difficult and requires you to combine different methods.

### Method 2: Share location on Facebook Messenger via Pinned Location

Let’s say there is a specific place you want to visit with your friend. Is there a way to share the address of the venue without you being there at the moment? Fortunately, it is possible. Apart from sharing your current location in real-time via Live Location, you can also send pinned locations on Messenger. You just need to search for it and then redirect the details to your friend. Yes. It’s just as simple as that. Do you want to try it on your smartphone? If so, follow the guide below.

- **Step 1:** Launch the **Facebook Messenger** application on your mobile device.

Check out the tutorial provided below.

- **Step 1:** Launch the **Google Maps** application on your mobile device.
