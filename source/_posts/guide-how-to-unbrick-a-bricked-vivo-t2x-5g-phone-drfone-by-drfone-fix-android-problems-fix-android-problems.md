## Part 1. Common Reasons Why Vivo T2x 5G Phones Get Bricked

A **bricked phone** might sound like a techy term, but it's pretty simple – when your Vivo T2x 5G phone turns into a lifeless block that won't do anything. In this section, you'll learn all about why this happens, so you can avoid these issues and keep your phone alive as long as possible.

![android logo head with broken glass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/how-to-unbrick-a-xiaomi-phone-02.jpg)

- **Trying to flash incompatible ROMs.** Sometimes, people want their Vivo T2x 5G phones to run different software like a custom version of Android called a ROM. But if you use the correct ROM for your specific phone, it can mess things up nicely. Also, inexperience with ROM flashing can **hard brick**your **Vivo T2x 5G** Be sure to follow guides and ask for community help online.
- **Rooting mishaps/failures.**"Rooting" means giving your phone superpowers, but if you mess up, it can go wrong. Your phone might not boot up, leaving you with a brick. Like the previous bullet, follow guides carefully, especially if inexperienced.

## What causes the Vivo T2x 5G Screen unresponsive?

The Vivo T2x 5G screen may become unresponsive due to various reasons. Here are some common situations and their possible causes:

- **During Use/Gaming:** The screen may become unresponsive due to overheating when using or gaming on a Vivo T2x 5G phone. This can be caused by running too many apps simultaneously or playing games for an extended period, especially on models such as the Vivo T2x 5G 9 Pro, which generates much heat during gaming.

- **No Response When Touching the Screen:**Sometimes, the Vivo T2x 5G screen may not respond when touched due to a faulty touch screen or display. This can happen due to physical damage or a manufacturing defect. Some Vivo T2x 5G Nord 2 users have reported this issue.

- **After Dropping the Phone:** If a Vivo T2x 5G phone has been dropped, the screen may become unresponsive due to physical damage or a loose connection. This can happen to any model, including the Vivo T2x 5G.

Overheating, physical damage, and manufacturing defects are some common causes of Vivo T2x 5G screen unresponsiveness, which may occur during use/gaming, no response when touching the screen, or after dropping the phone.

Make sure to regularly check for and install software updates on your Vivo T2x 5G phone. These updates often include bug fixes and security patches that can help prevent issues like overheating and screen unresponsiveness.

### Check Hardware from Time to Time

Regularly inspect your phone's hardware components such as charging ports, battery, and screen for any signs of damage or wear and tear. If you notice any issues, get them fixed promptly to prevent them from causing further damage.

### Avoid extreme temperatures

Keep your Vivo T2x 5G device in a temperature-controlled environment. High temperatures can cause the screen to become unresponsive, and low temperatures can cause it to freeze.

### Keep the screen clean

Dirt and debris on the screen can cause it to become unresponsive. Use a microfiber cloth to clean the screen regularly.

### Reduce the number of running apps

Running too many apps at once can overload the system and cause the screen to become unresponsive. Close any apps you're not using to free up system resources.
