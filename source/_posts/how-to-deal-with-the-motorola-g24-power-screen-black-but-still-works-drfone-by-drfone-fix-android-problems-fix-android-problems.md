### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software. This problem suggests that your Motorola G24 Power is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately.

![go back to “Settings”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985108996306.jpg)

![turn on “USB Debugging”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985109282251.jpg)

This should solve the problem. If not, move on to the other techniques.

#### **2.4 Check APK File**

An incomplete and irregular App installation may cause the .apk file to get corrupted. Make sure you download the file completely. If need be, delete the existing App or its .apk file and reinstall it from Google Play Store for it to be compatible with your device’s software and to use the App smoothly.

#### **2.5 Check App Manifest File**

Manifested App files are nothing but .apk files which are improvised by you. Such changes may cause the Parse Error to occur more frequently. Modifications in the App file can be made by changing its name, App settings, or more advanced customizations. Make sure you roll back all changes and restore the App file to its original state to prevent it from getting corrupted.

#### **2.6 Disable Antivirus and other cleaner Apps**

Antivirus software and other cleaning Apps are very helpful in blocking unwanted and harmful Apps from damaging your device. However, sometimes such Apps also prevent you from using other safe Apps.

We do not suggest that you delete the Antivirus App permanently. Temporary uninstallation will be useful here. To do so:

• Visit “Settings” and then select “Apps”.

• Select the antivirus App to click on “Uninstall” and then tap “OK”.

![click on “Uninstall”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985109617315.jpg)

Now download and install the desired App again. Once this is done, do not forget to install the Antivirus App again.

#### **2.7 Clear Cache cookies of Play Store**

Clearing Play Store Cache cleans the Android Market platform by deleting all clogged up unwanted data. Follow the steps given below to delete Play Store cache:

• Tap on Google Play Store App.

• Now visit Play Store’s “Settings”.

![“Clear local search history”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985110201340.jpg)

#### **2.8 Factory Reset Android**

Factory Resetting your device to fix the Parse Error should be the last thing you try. Make sure you take a back-up of all your data on your Google Account or a Pen Drive because this technique erases all media, contents, data, and other files, including your device settings.

Follow the steps given below to factory reset your device:

• Visit “Settings”.

• Now select “Backup and Reset”.

![select “Backup and Reset”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985110589339.jpg)

## Part 1: Reasons Behind the App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Issue

Encountering the "**Google Play App Not Available in Your Country**" issue can feel like hitting a roadblock. This restriction hampers your ability to explore and use valuable apps. It can also disrupt the smooth functioning of your daily digital activities. Before going for solutions, it is crucial to understand the reasons causing this restriction in installing apps on smartphones:

### 1\. Regional Restrictions

One of the primary culprits behind this issue is the regional restrictions imposed by developers. Developers often roll out their apps gradually across different regions. It is done to adhere to legal and licensing requirements. This staggered release strategy ensures compliance with local laws. Moreover, it guarantees a smooth user experience tailored to specific geographical locations.

### 2\. Licensing and Legal Constraints

Licensing agreements and legal constraints play an important role when it comes to the accessibility of apps. Developers may encounter licensing issues. This can prevent them from offering their apps in certain regions. It is due to copyright, trademark, or other legal considerations. Navigating the complex web of international laws and agreements is a big hassle. It becomes a determining factor in the availability of apps on the Play Store.

### 3\. Localization Challenges

Apps are often designed with specific markets in mind. These incorporate language, cultural, and regulatory considerations to enhance user experience. The absence of proper localization can render an app incompatible with specific regions. It includes factors such as adapting the app for different languages, currencies, and cultural nuances. This can result in the app being excluded from the **Play Store app not available in your country.**

### 4\. Device and OS Compatibility

The compatibility between the app, the user's device, and its OS is another factor that contributes to this issue. Developers might restrict their app availability to certain devices or OS versions. It can restrict access for users whose devices or OS do not meet the app's requirements. This technical limitation adds another layer to the complexity of app availability.

### 5\. Political and Economic Factors

In some instances, political tensions or economic considerations can also be a factor. It may influence the accessibility of apps in certain countries. Geo-political factors, trade sanctions, or economic conditions can impact the distribution of apps. This leads developers to exclude specific regions from their app's availability.

The positive aspect is that many solutions exist for addressing this issue. Presented below are the top 4 approaches to resolving this matter:

### Method 1: Change Your Google Play Store Country

One of the most direct ways to address this issue is by manually adjusting your Google Play Store country settings. Google allows users to change their country or region. Remember that you can only do it once a year. To utilize this approach, it's essential to reside in the specified country. The other option is to provide a payment method originating from that particular region. Below is a detailed walkthrough for this procedure:

- **Step 1.** Launch the Google Play Store on your Motorola G24 Power and tap the “Profile” icon from the top right corner. Here, choose "Settings" and follow on to tap "General."

### Method 2: Use a Reliable VPN

Confronting the message "**This app is not accessible in your country" on the Play Store**? Employing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be an effective strategy. It allows you to virtually transcend geographical restrictions. A VPN masks your actual location by routing your internet connection through servers in different regions.

You can utilize a reliable VPN to access the Play Store as though you were in a region where the desired app is accessible. Follow this step-by-step guide to address this concern:

- **Step 1.** Access the Google Play Store and download a reliable VPN for the procedure. Open the VPN you download and connect to the country of your choice. Once you have connected your device’s IP to another country using the VPN, continue to your home screen.

### Method 3: Download an APK File

One way to resolve the issue at hand is to sideload the app by downloading its APK file. It can be a viable and direct solution where other methods fail. This method involves installing the application manually, bypassing the Google Play Store. Follow these sequential instructions to download and install an APK file:

- **Step 1.** Before starting, ensure that you have enabled the installation from unknown sources. Afterward, find a reliable website and search for your targeted apps.

![download apk from website](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-6.jpg)

### Method 4: Try a Third-Party App Store

Google Play Store isn't the only apps and games store. There exist many options, and exploring them can help you find the apps you are looking for. Typically, third-party app marketplaces are not bound by geographical limitations. Here's a guide on acquiring an app from a third-party store:

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **How do we resolve the inability to change the Play Store country problem?**

If you are unable to change your Play Store country, ensure that your Google Play Store account has no pending transactions.
