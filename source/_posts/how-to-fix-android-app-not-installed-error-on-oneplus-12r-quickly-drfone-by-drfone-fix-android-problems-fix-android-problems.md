## Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error

You may ask: Why can't I download apps on my OnePlus 12R? Understanding the underlying causes of the "Android App Not Installed" error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:

1\. Insufficient storage

Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.

2\. Corrupted/Contaminated App file

When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.

3\. SD Card not mounted in the OnePlus 12R device

At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.

4\. Storage location

You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the OnePlus 12R device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn't installed because of an unknown Error Code.

5\. Corrupt storage

Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn't installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.

6\. Application Permission

Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.

7\. Incorrect file

If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.

## Part 1: Clear the cache of Settings and Google Play Service

It is possible that the corrupted cache files are responsible for this error. Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:

1. Open “Settings” on your OnePlus 12R and choose “Apps & Notifications”/”Apps”/”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).
2. In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.
3. Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.

## Part 2: Clear the Android phone’s RAM and retry

As the next tip, we would like to suggest you clear your device’s RAM by ceasing the running apps in the background.

Here is how to do it.

1. Firstly, you need to go to the Recent apps screen. For this, long-press the Home key.  
    Note: Please note that different devices have different ways to go to the Recent apps screen. Do it according to the OnePlus 12R device you own.
2. Now, swipe the apps and tap on the clear option. You will be able to notice the amount of RAM cleared

## Part 3: Useful Tips to avoid Bricking your Android Phone

If you are planning on installing custom ROM you need to install Custom Recovery. This will enable you restore the OnePlus 12R device to its original settings should anything go wrong and hopefully help you avoid bricking your device.

1. Ensure that you are familiar with the Fastboot or ADB commands before doing anything. You should know how to recover your device by flashing a command line and also manually transfer important files to your device.
2. Make a backup of your device. This is obvious but most people fail to adhere to it. At the very least you can get back all your files and settings to transfer to a new phone.
3. Keep a full Nandroid backup on your phone
4. Keep another backup on your PC which you can access should anything go wrong with the Custom ROM installation
5. Know how to hard reset your device. It may come in handy when your device freezes on you.
6. You should also consider enabling USB debugging. This is because many solutions for a Bricked device rely on USB debugging.
7. Ensure the Custom ROM you choose can actually be used on your device model.

While installing Custom ROM can actually be a great way to customize your device, it is also the leading reason for bricked devices. Therefore ensure that you understand what you are doing when you decide to customize your device. Learn as much as you can about the process before attempting everything.
