## Part 1: What Are the Causes Behind Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

There are many reasons for ****the app crashing**** on Android devices. These reasons range from insufficient storage space to bugs and glitches in the apps. Finding out the root cause of an app crashing is important so that you can find the appropriate solution. Discussed below are some of the reasons why your Android apps keep crashing:

### Insufficient Memory

When a device is low on memory, it may struggle to run multiple apps simultaneously. Each app requires memory to store its data and execute its processes. If the available memory is limited, it can cause apps to crash. That happens because they don't have enough resources to operate properly.

### Software Compatibility

Android devices come in various models and run different operating system versions. That's why it is essential to use apps compatible with your device. Since there are a lot of Android variants, it is hard to optimize apps for all devices. An app not optimized for an Android version or device leads to crashes or malfunctions.

### Outdated Apps

Apps are regularly updated to introduce new features, fix bugs, and enhance performance. Using an outdated version of an app may cause instability or compatibility problems. Since the app is not optimized for the current version of Android, it can keep crashing.

### Network Problems

Some apps rely heavily on network connectivity to function properly. They need a stable and strong internet connection to perform all the functions. These apps can crash if there are network connectivity issues, such as a weak Wi-Fi or network outage. Unstable connections can disrupt data transmission, making the app's function challenging.

## 9 Quick Fixes to Unfortunately TouchWiz has stopped Of Infinix Smart 8

“Unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped” is the talk of the town due to annoying TouchWiz UI, a front-end user interface developed by Infinix Smart 8. Not to mention, the Infinix Smart 8 has borne a whole lot of heat from its agitated users over the years and the reason is pretty much obvious due to the pre-installed bloatware apps and the theme launch “TouchWiz home”. That not just brutally annoys users and eats up a heck of internal storage space but lags up too often due to low speed and stability. As a result users end up with “Unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped” and “Unfortunately, TouchWiz has stopped”. Apparently, there are several flaws in the design and functioning of this launcher and hence, Touchwiz keeps stopping or becomes unresponsive.

## Part 1: Common scenarios when TouchWiz keeps stopping

Here in this section, we will introduce some scenarios that can be blamed for why **_TouchWiz is not working_**. Check out the following points:

- More often than not, the **_TouchWiz keeps stopping_** **<u>after an Android update. </u>** When we update our Infinix Smart 8 device, the old data and cache usually conflicts with TouchWIz thereby cropping up this mess.
- When you **<u>disable some built-in apps</u>**, you might get in trouble with TouchWiz. Doing this sometimes can hamper the TouchWiz operation and raise the “**_unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped_**” error message.
- Many times **<u>installing some third-party apps and widgets</u>** can cause this problem. The apps like launchers can be conflicting with TouchWiz home launcher and therefore cease it to work. Also, a glitched widget is responsible for the same i.e. forces stop the TouchWiz.
