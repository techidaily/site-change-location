## Part 2: How to Fix Your Bricked Android Phone

Android devices are usually very flexible in allowing users to flash ROM but sometimes an incorrect process can result in a bricked device. While there are few solutions to this problem, here are a few things you can do;

### When the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device Boots Straight into Recovery

If the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device can boot to the recovery screen, you can find an alternative ROM to install and copy it your device. Installation can then be done in the recovery menu. If the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device is booting to recovery mode there is a chance that it can be fixed.

Step 1: Load up Clockworkmod or any other recovery tool that you have been using.

Step 2: Once you are in, navigate to the “Reboot system now.” If you are using Clockworkmod, this should be your first option. Hopefully everything will work just right if you do this, If it doesn’t you may need to download and re-flash the ROM again.
