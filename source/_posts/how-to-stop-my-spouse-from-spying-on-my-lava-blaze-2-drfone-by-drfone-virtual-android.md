## Part 3: The Most Effective Way to Fake Location on iOS and Android

We have mentioned methods to change Play Store country manually and through VPN, but they still have a few limitations. Once you change the country's location on Google Play manually, the Play Store requires 48 hours to accept this modification. Moreover, you can only change the country's server location once a year. With VPN, many country servers are unreachable, and some servers can be reached only through a paid version. This makes the process expensive and time taking.

To avoid these hurdles and chaos, we recommend you to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location to fake your location on both Android and iOS devices. This tool works in every situation and allows users to travel the globe through their phones free of cost. You can also travel with an exact GPS location just with a single click.

Also, set up passwords on your special media accounts and related activities. Putting a screen lock on your device will also prevent your spouse from getting access to your phone.

**Method 2: Fake a location to anti-spy from your spouse**

Another way is to anti-spy from your spouse which means that let him spy on you but he/she will get the wrong information about your location and activities. For anti-spying, take the help of the below methods.

1. VPNs

By changing the VPN of your device, you can set a false location and your spouse will be tricked and will be forced to believe that you are somewhere else than your actual location. To change Virtual Private Network (VPN) there are different services available and some of the most popularly used ones are Express VPN, IPVanish, SurfShark, NordVPN, and others.

**Method 3: Take advantage of anti-spyware software**

### Response 3: Seek a Divorce

Spying on your spouse is not only illegal but also unethical. So, if you feel that your trust has been shattered by your spouse by keeping an eye on your phone and your activities and staying with him/her does not seem to be possible, seek a divorce. It's better to come out of a relationship, instead of staying the one where there is no trust or respect.
