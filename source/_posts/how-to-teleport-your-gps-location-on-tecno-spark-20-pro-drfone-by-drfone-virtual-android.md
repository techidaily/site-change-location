## Part 1: Is Life360 a spy app?

You might have learned from your friends or social media about various applications that allow you to track other devices, view text messages, and track everything someone does on their device. No one, including your circle members, can spy on what you do on your devices, like checking your internet history or reading texts.

It does not work when the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device is turned off, or its battery is dead.

**6\. Battery level:** Life360 may have access to the battery level of the Tecno Spark 20 Pro devices connected to the app. This information can be used to provide alerts when a family member's device is low on battery.
