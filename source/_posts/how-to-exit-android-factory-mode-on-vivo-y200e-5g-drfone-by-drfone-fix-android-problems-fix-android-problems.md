## Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone

Insufficient storage could be the other reason why for your WhatsApp has stopped. When your device starts running out of space, some apps may not be able to operate properly for their functions take up space in the Vivo Y200e 5G device. And probably WhatsApp is one of them. If the space is the case with you, we suggest you the following two things to go with.

- Firstly, go to Settings and check the storage. Make sure it is enough i.e. at least 100 to 200MB.
- Secondly, start eliminating the apps that are no longer needed. This will indeed create more space in your device and will let your WhatsApp wok properly.

## Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked

It is a well-known fact that Android device and Gmail account go hand in hand. To run the Vivo Y200e 5G device smoothly, it is always asked to enter your Gmail address for further configurations. And when WhatsApp stops on your device, the reason might be your Gmail account. Most probably it is not valid now or maybe hacked. If this is the case, we suggest you to log out and log in with some another Gmail account.

- Log out by opening “Settings” and tap on “Accounts”.
- Choose your Google account and tap on “REMOVE ACCOUNT”.

![whatsapp stopping - fix gmail account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/log-out-gmail.jpg)

Now, you can login again and check if WhatsApp works or not.

## Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone

If still nothing works and your WhatsApp keeps stopping, most likely the reason is the incompatibility of your WhatsApp with your device. In such case, the thing that comes to your rescue is mod WhatsApp version like GBWhatsApp. It is a mod app which is similar to WhatsApp but in a more modified way. With this, a user gets more functionalities and customizable settings when compared to WhatsApp.
