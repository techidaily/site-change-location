## Part 1. What is Android Factory Mode?

Factory mode or what is commonly known as factory reset is one of the options available for you when your Meizu 21 is in recovery mode.

This option is useful in solving a whole host of problems that your device could be experiencing.

If you have been using your Meizu 21 for a while now and its performance to be less than ideal, a factory reset might be a good solution. That is however not the only problem a factory reset or factory mode can solve. It will also work for a number or Android errors that you may experience, problems caused by faulty firmware updates and also tweaks made on your device that may not have worked as expected.

It is however important to note that a factory reset or factory mode does often result in the loss of all your data. Therefore a backup is necessary to protect against this data loss risk.

## Part 2. Backup your Android Device First

## Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System

Losing data on your Meizu 21 is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don't really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here's how to easily do that.

Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Meizu 21, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the "Backup & Restore" option on the screen.

Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.

Step 3: After the process is complete, choose "Reboot" to restart the Meizu 21 device.

Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery > backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.

To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.

Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup & Restore from the menu list.

Step 2: Press "Restore" to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created

Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.

Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.
