- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

![trading increases the chance of perfect ivs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg)

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.

With the maps, you can get live locations of all the rarest and 100 IV Pokémon Go maps.

Here are some of these reliable 100 IV Pokémon Go trackers that you can use.

### 1\. [The Silph Road](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-silph-road-shut-down.html)

### 2\. Pokémon Go Map

Pokémon Go Map is another Pokémon Go 100 IV map for you if you want to quickly find and catch rare Pokémon without spending hours wandering around.

![pokemap](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pokemon-go-100-iv-map.jpg)

Further, the map shows the gym in red and Pokestops in blue by default. Therefore, it helps you to your route and trip to catch the Pokémon and to shop as well. Also, when you click on a particular Pokestop or Gym, this will show you the look of the stop, which you can share with other players.

![pokemongomap](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/EX-Raid-Gym-Map-7.jpg)

You can also search for postcodes in Pokémon Go Map. But this map is not affiliated with Pokémon Go or Niantic. So, you need to download it from the site.

### 3\. PokeDex 100

This is another popular directory of Pokémon that is solely dedicated to 100 IV Pokémon. Although its app is no longer available, you can access this Pokémon Go Map 100 IV by visiting its website.

**Website:** [https://pokedex100.com/](https://pokedex100.com/)

### 4\. The IV 100 App

This **Pokémon Go 100 IV map** is available for free for Android users and can be downloaded from the Play Store. You can just launch the app and use its filter to select the specific Pokémon you wish to catch. It will look into its database and would display the 100 IV Pokémon Go map for that specific Pokémon.

This map is for Android devices. However, it is not available on the Play Store, so you need to install it from a third-party source.

## Conclusion

That’s a wrap, everyone! Now that you know about the Pokémon Go 100 IV maps that actually work, you can easily catch these powerful Pokémon. Though, after noting their coordinates from a Pokémon IV 100 map, you would need to use a location spoofer app. I would recommend [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) since it is pretty easy to use and will not need any jailbreak access as well. You can spoof your iPhone location to anywhere you want and also just simulate your movements realistically.
