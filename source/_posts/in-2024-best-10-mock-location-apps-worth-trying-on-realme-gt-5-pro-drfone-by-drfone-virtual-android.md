## Part I: Purpose of Mock Location Apps

The sole purpose of mock location apps or software is to help users spoof/ mock location to somewhere they are physically not. This may or may not be illegal/ immoral depending on how you use the apps, but who are we to judge! We are here to simply help you with the process.

- Prank your friends and family by showing your location in some other country and have some healthy laughs at their expense!
- Access geographically restricted content such as on streaming platforms. Mocking your location to somewhere where your favorite shows and movies are available helps you watch them from the comfort of your home, wherever in the world that may be!
- If you are an avid Snapchat user, certain filters are only available in certain locations, and you can mock location on iPhone or Android to avail of them.
- Location-based games such as Pokémon GO derive the most benefit from a mock location app because you can change your location and show yourself walking in the streets of London while sipping a mojito at a beach in Hawaii and catching amazing new Pokémon!
- In dating apps, why pay a fee to unlock worldwide access when you can simply use a mock location app to let the dating app change your current location automatically in accordance with your selection in the location spoofer app on your Android or iPhone?

## Part II: Is It Safe to Mock Location? Can It Be Detected?

One of the most frequent and completely understandable concern and question on people’s minds when they talk about location spoofing is whether is it safe to mock location whether it can be detected and what the consequences are.

Answer: Location spoofing is safe and will go undetected as long as it is done sensibly and with the right mock location app on your iPhone and Android. You have nothing to worry about as long as you do not be particularly obvious about location mocking. This means that you should take care not to be hopping like a bunny from here and there in minutes.

## Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone

There are fewer mock location apps on the Apple Store due to Apple's strict policies on user privacy and security. Apple prioritizes maintaining a secure and reliable user experience, which limits the availability of apps that could potentially misuse location data. Therefore, this part will mainly introduce five softwares that need to be installed on a computer. Let’s come to the apps! Here are the top location spoofer apps for iPhone.

#### 1\. [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

![drfone virtual location ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location.jpg)

This is by far the best one out there. It is designed professionally and inspires trust, unlike some other apps that neither look as polished nor work as flawlessly. When in doubt, trust Wondershare’s Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to do the job reliably and professionally in just a few clicks.



### [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

#### 2\. iTools

![itools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-3.jpg)

iTools by ThinkSkySoft is another great location spoofer you can use. It has an easy-to-understand interface and gets the job done.

iToolab is another popular location spoofer for iPhone and comes with some powerful features that you might want. It is continually developed, which means it supports the latest iOS 17 as well.

#### 4\. iMoveGo

![imovego](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-5.jpg)

A quality product from Wootechy, iMoveGo is compatible with the latest iOS 17 and works well for what it does. It does not require jailbreak and comes with a trial version you can use to see what it does and if it fits your purpose.

#### 5\. iSpoofer

![ispoofer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-6.jpg)

Probably one of the most known apps at one point in time, iSpoofer was great at spoofing location on iPhone until Niantic, the makers of Pokémon GO, detected the app, and banned it. The app still works with some tricks up its sleeve, but we do not really recommend it, given that it was detected once and if you are detected using the app, you will be banned from the Poke-verse for good.

![drfone virtual location android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-android.jpg)

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location can be used to effectively spoof GPS coordinates on Android devices as well. An issue that other spoofing apps present is that the location might jump between its true location and falsified location, which means that other apps might present a location spoofing solution that is not stable. That is not the case with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android) where a location once set remains set as long as you want it to, and will not jump.

At this point, instructions change depending on the Realme GT 5 Pro device you connected. There are different instructions for iPhone and Android. Please visit [this](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/connect-android-ios-device-to-fake-location.html) link to connect your specific device.

Step 4: After you have connected your respective device, now comes the fun part – spoofing your location! If you want to simply prank your friends or use dating apps and other apps where you simply want a different location, you can use the Jump Teleport mode to simply change your location to anywhere in the world.

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

\- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.

## Closing Words

On another note, we will share with you the limitation of the Foneazy MockGo software. Currently, this application is only available for iOS phone users, and Android users. Therefore, you are not able to use this software. Another limitation is that it does not support macOS versions that are older than 10.10. Reaching out to their customer support can also take a long time as they take time to respond to you. Lastly, the software will stop updating, and you will need to check yourself if the software needs to be updated.

## Part 2: How to Fix Foneazy MockGo Not Working Issue

Being able to share a spoof location or use it in games is fun and a great way to fool any of your friends. However, while using the Foneazy MockGo software, you will encounter instances where it is not working properly. Therefore, we will share with you some quick fixes and checks that you can do on your own to fix the temporary issue within the software.

**_Option #1:_** Check if the software is updated to the latest software. You can check if you need an update by going to the menu for the “check for upgrade” button. Once it says that an update is available, do update the software as the update could contain some fixes for some issues in the software from its previous versions.

**_Option #2:_** Make sure your iOS phone is also updated to the latest version. Double-check if your phone needs updating in the phone settings and update it as needed. If the phone is not updated, it can also hinder some features of the software.

**_Option #3:_** Ensure that your location sharing is enabled on your phone. Despite sharing a spoof location, you will still need to enable your location sharing so the software can track wherever you currently are. You can do this by going to your phone's setting and going to “location” to enable sharing.

**_Option #4:_** Restart your phone or computer. If you have exhausted all the tips we shared, you can try this basic troubleshooting to fix this issue. Usually, just a quick restart on your phone or computer can help to make your Foneazy MockGo work again.

Try all of these tricks that we have shared and get that temporary issue in Foneazy MockGo fixed in no time.
