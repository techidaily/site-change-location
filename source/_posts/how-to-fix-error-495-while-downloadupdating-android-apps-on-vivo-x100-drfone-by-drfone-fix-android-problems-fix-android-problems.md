## Common Causes of Vivo X100 Screen Unresponsiveness

While Vivo X100 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Vivo X100 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Vivo X100, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Vivo X100 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Vivo X100 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Vivo X100 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Vivo X100 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Vivo X100 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Vivo X100 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Vivo X100 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid Vivo X100 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent Vivo X100 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Vivo X100 device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid Vivo X100 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Vivo X100 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Vivo X100 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Vivo X100 App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Vivo X100 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data. With features such as System Repair and Data Backup & Restore, you can quickly diagnose and fix software issues that may cause unresponsiveness and safely back up important data to prevent loss in case of device damage or malfunction.

### Conclusion

Vivo X100 Screen unresponsiveness can be a frustrating issue to deal with, but there are solutions available. Force restarting the Vivo X100 device, checking for software updates, using Dr. Fone Repair, and contacting customer service are all effective ways to solve the problem. However, it's also important to understand the possible causes of the issue, such as soft-bricking or equipment wearing out, and take preventative measures, such as updating your phone on time and avoiding malware. These tips can help prevent Vivo X100 Screen unresponsiveness and keep your device running smoothly.

• Visit “Settings” and select “About Device”.

![click on “Build Number”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985108749996.jpg)

If need be, delete the existing App or its .apk file and reinstall it from Google Play Store for it to be compatible with your device’s software and to use the App smoothly.

#### **2.5 Check App Manifest File**

Manifested App files are nothing but .apk files which are improvised by you. Such changes may cause the Parse Error to occur more frequently. Modifications in the App file can be made by changing its name, App settings, or more advanced customizations. Make sure you roll back all changes and restore the App file to its original state to prevent it from getting corrupted.

• Select the antivirus App to click on “Uninstall” and then tap “OK”.

• Tap on Google Play Store App.

• Now visit Play Store’s “Settings”.
