Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch.

Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.
