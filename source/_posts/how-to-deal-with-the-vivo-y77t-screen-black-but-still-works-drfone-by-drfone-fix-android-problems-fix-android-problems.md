### A Drained Battery

The first thing that comes to mind when your **phone screen suddenly goes black** is you have a drained battery. Even though this is obvious, it’s still important to mention, as this is usually what most people encounter.

![drained iphone battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/how-to-deal-with-the-phone-screen-black-but-still-works-02.jpg)

### App Troubles

If your **phone is working, but the screen is black,** there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application. An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.

### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software. This problem suggests that your Vivo Y77t is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately. If this is the cause, then your device is likely experiencing a critical system error, and you should directly try to reboot your phone.

### Hardware Problem

If you dropped your phone, there’s a high chance the LCD connectors went loose due to the physical impact. If this happened to you, the phone might be working, but the screen is black due to the LCD cable dislodging. Another issue could be your phone got exposed to extreme temperatures. This can also cause a **black screen but your phone is still on.**

## Part 1. Preliminary Reasons For Cellular Network Not Available For Voice Calls

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892107/21290" target="_top" id="1892107"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892107" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892107/21290" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033095&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced-3YR.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

<a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436" border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Network Congestion

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the Vivo Y77t device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Battery or Power Issues

In some instances, [<u>insufficient battery power</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-your-phone-battery-health.html) or power-saving modes on devices can cause this issue. They affect the Vivo Y77t device's capacity to sustain a consistent connection with the cellular network. This consequently causes voice call unavailability.

## **What causes a Vivo Y77t Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Vivo Y77t phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Vivo Y77t device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Vivo Y77t smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Vivo Y77t 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

### **There might be issues with the Vivo Y77t device itself**

Screens on Vivo Y77t devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every Vivo Y77t device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.
