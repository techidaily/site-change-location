This can happen to various models, such as the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.
