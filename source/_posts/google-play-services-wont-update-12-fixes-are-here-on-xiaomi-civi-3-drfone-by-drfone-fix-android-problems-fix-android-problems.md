### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 1: Head to the “Settings” of your Xiaomi Civi 3 and then opt for “Wireless and Networks” followed by “WLAN/WiFi”.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 3: Depending on your Xiaomi Civi 3 model, look for “IP Settings” and tap on it. Now, switch the “DHCP” to “Static”.

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.

However, there is no need to worry, as this article will help you in resolving this issue. It will delve into effective strategies and solutions to ensure the unavailability of an app is no longer an obstacle.

## Part 1: Reasons Behind the App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Issue

Encountering the "**Google Play App Not Available in Your Country**" issue can feel like hitting a roadblock. This restriction hampers your ability to explore and use valuable apps. It can also disrupt the smooth functioning of your daily digital activities. Before going for solutions, it is crucial to understand the reasons causing this restriction in installing apps on smartphones:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Regional Restrictions

One of the primary culprits behind this issue is the regional restrictions imposed by developers. Developers often roll out their apps gradually across different regions. It is done to adhere to legal and licensing requirements. This staggered release strategy ensures compliance with local laws. Moreover, it guarantees a smooth user experience tailored to specific geographical locations.

### 2\. Licensing and Legal Constraints

Licensing agreements and legal constraints play an important role when it comes to the accessibility of apps. Developers may encounter licensing issues. This can prevent them from offering their apps in certain regions. It is due to copyright, trademark, or other legal considerations. Navigating the complex web of international laws and agreements is a big hassle. It becomes a determining factor in the availability of apps on the Play Store.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Localization Challenges

Apps are often designed with specific markets in mind. These incorporate language, cultural, and regulatory considerations to enhance user experience. The absence of proper localization can render an app incompatible with specific regions. It includes factors such as adapting the app for different languages, currencies, and cultural nuances. This can result in the app being excluded from the **Play Store app not available in your country.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Device and OS Compatibility

The compatibility between the app, the user's device, and its OS is another factor that contributes to this issue. Developers might restrict their app availability to certain devices or OS versions. It can restrict access for users whose devices or OS do not meet the app's requirements. This technical limitation adds another layer to the complexity of app availability.

### 5\. Political and Economic Factors

In some instances, political tensions or economic considerations can also be a factor. It may influence the accessibility of apps in certain countries. Geo-political factors, trade sanctions, or economic conditions can impact the distribution of apps. This leads developers to exclude specific regions from their app's availability.

## Part 2: 4 Tested Methods To Fix Google Play App Not Available in Your Country

The right app can make a major difference in work efficiency or personal enjoyment. That's why facing the "**Play Store app not available in your country**" issue can be frustrating. The positive aspect is that many solutions exist for addressing this issue. Presented below are the top 4 approaches to resolving this matter:

### Method 1: Change Your Google Play Store Country

One of the most direct ways to address this issue is by manually adjusting your Google Play Store country settings. Google allows users to change their country or region. Remember that you can only do it once a year. To utilize this approach, it's essential to reside in the specified country. The other option is to provide a payment method originating from that particular region. Below is a detailed walkthrough for this procedure:

- **Step 1.** Launch the Google Play Store on your Xiaomi Civi 3 and tap the “Profile” icon from the top right corner. Here, choose "Settings" and follow on to tap "General."

![general settings play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Use a Reliable VPN

Confronting the message "**This app is not accessible in your country" on the Play Store**? Employing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be an effective strategy. It allows you to virtually transcend geographical restrictions. A VPN masks your actual location by routing your internet connection through servers in different regions.

You can utilize a reliable VPN to access the Play Store as though you were in a region where the desired app is accessible. Follow this step-by-step guide to address this concern:

- **Step 1.** Access the Google Play Store and download a reliable VPN for the procedure. Open the VPN you download and connect to the country of your choice. Once you have connected your device’s IP to another country using the VPN, continue to your home screen.

![get vpn from play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-3.jpg)

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **How do we resolve the inability to change the Play Store country problem?**

If you are unable to change your Play Store country, ensure that your Google Play Store account has no pending transactions. Verify that the payment methods associated with your Google account are valid. Clear the cache and data of the Google Play Store app in your device settings to reset any potential issues.

2. **Can you use the Google Play Store balance after changing the country?**

Your Google Play Balance is linked to the country setting on your Google Play account. If you possess a Google Play balance and decide to switch countries, the balance becomes unusable in the new location. Changing countries on your account results in the inability to access or utilize the existing balance.

3. **Is it safe to download Android applications from a third-party store?**

It is risky to download Android applications from a third-party store because of the viral content. There could be issues like App Authenticity, Outdated Apps, Policy Violations, etc. It is better to download these apps from official platforms like Google Play Store since they are more secure.

## Conclusion

To summarize, the pursuit of the perfect app sometimes encounters hurdles. One frustrating issue often reported by users is the "**App Not Available in Your Country Play Store**" issue. However, armed with the knowledge, you can now navigate through these challenges. From changing your Play Store country to using VPNs, this guide has covered a range of methods.
