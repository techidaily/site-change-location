**Step 4:** Now, you will be automatically assisted in changing the payment methods of the new country. However, if you don't come across the option to change the country, either you have already changed the country location within a year or your IP address is not synchronized with your new country.

**Situation 2: How to Change Google Account Location on Android**

In this particular situation, you don’t have to **change the** **Play** **Store** **country**; instead, you can only **change** **the** **Google** **location** on your Lava Blaze 2 Pro. We will recommend the [VPN Proxy Master Lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.vpn.unblock.fast.proxy.vpn.master.pro.lite&hl=en&gl=US), which works effortlessly to **change** **Google**'s **location**. This tool flawlessly hides your IP address so that you can easily use any country's location to access all the applications and services. Moreover, it's highly secured and well-protected so that no virus can harm your Lava Blaze 2 Pro.

To use this powerful VPN tool, we have jotted down some basic steps through which you can change the location on your phone easily:

## Part 3: The Most Effective Way to Fake Location on iOS and Android

We have mentioned methods to change Play Store country manually and through VPN, but they still have a few limitations. Once you change the country's location on Google Play manually, the Play Store requires 48 hours to accept this modification. Moreover, you can only change the country's server location once a year. With VPN, many country servers are unreachable, and some servers can be reached only through a paid version. This makes the process expensive and time taking.

To avoid these hurdles and chaos, we recommend you to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location to fake your location on both Android and iOS devices. This tool works in every situation and allows users to travel the globe through their phones free of cost. You can also travel with an exact GPS location just with a single click. Hence, this tool will work amazingly in faking your location without requiring you to change Google Play country's location.
