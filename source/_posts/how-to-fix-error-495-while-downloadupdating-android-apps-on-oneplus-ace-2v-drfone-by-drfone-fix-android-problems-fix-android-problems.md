## Part 1: Basic Troubleshooting and Fixes

Pandora, the music streaming app cherished by Android users, accompanies you on your musical journey. It offers an array of melodies at our fingertips. However, occasional crashes can disrupt this harmonious experience. This results in an annoying experience where **Pandora keeps stopping on Android** phones.

Crashes often result from glitches or bugs within the app’s code. These unexpected errors can cause Pandora to freeze, lag, or abruptly shut down, hindering its smooth operation. When faced with intermittent crashes, several basic fixes can help restore Pandora’s functionality:

- **Closing the app.** Simply closing and reopening Pandora might resolve transient issues.
- **Restarting the phone.** A [reboot of your OnePlus Ace 2V](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/reboot-samsung.html) can clear temporary glitches affecting Pandora.
- **Updating the app.** Ensure you have the latest version of Pandora installed. Updating the app can rectify bugs from older versions.
- **Reinstalling the app.**If the problem persists, uninstall Pandora and reinstall it from the Google Play Store. This process can refresh the app’s data and settings, potentially resolving persistent issues.

If these basic fixes fail to address the continuous crashing of the Pandora app, or if the crashes persist over an extended period, the next section will provide advanced solutions. These initial troubleshooting steps aim to tackle common and temporary issues that could impede Pandora’s performance. If the problem persists, it might necessitate more intricate resolutions or further investigation into the app’s underlying technicalities.
