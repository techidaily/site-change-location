## Part 1. What is Android Factory Mode?

Factory mode or what is commonly known as factory reset is one of the options available for you when your Poco C51 is in recovery mode. Several options are available for you once you enter Recovery mode on your device but few are as effective as the wipe data/ factory reset option. This option is useful in solving a whole host of problems that your device could be experiencing.

If you have been using your Poco C51 for a while now and its performance to be less than ideal, a factory reset might be a good solution. That is however not the only problem a factory reset or factory mode can solve. It will also work for a number or Android errors that you may experience, problems caused by faulty firmware updates and also tweaks made on your device that may not have worked as expected.

It is however important to note that a factory reset or factory mode does often result in the loss of all your data. Therefore a backup is necessary to protect against this data loss risk.

![boot into safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/boot-loop-android.jpg)

Booting your Poco C51 into Safe Mode is a useful troubleshooting step to fix boot loop issues caused by third-party apps. When in Safe Mode, the Poco C51 device will start up with only essential system apps, and any downloaded apps that might be causing conflicts won't run. Here's how you can boot your Poco C51 into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:

**Step 1: Power Off Your Device**

Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.

**Step 2: Access Safe Mode**

To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:

- For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer's logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Poco C51 device finishes booting. You should see "Safe Mode" displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.
- Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device's user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.

**Step 3: Observe the Poco C51 device**

Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn't occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.

**Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps**

Now that you're in Safe Mode, it's time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.

**Step 5: Restart Normally**

Once you've identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.

By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Poco C51.

![cellular network not available calls error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cellular-network-not-available-for-voice-calls-android-1.jpg)

## Part 1. Preliminary Reasons For Cellular Network Not Available For Voice Calls

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

### 3\. Network Congestion

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.
