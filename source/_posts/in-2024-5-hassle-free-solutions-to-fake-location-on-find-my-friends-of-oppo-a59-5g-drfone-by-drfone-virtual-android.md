So that way, you are able to check what other locations in the world have in their area than being limited to the area that you are in.

Aside from giving you a temporary location, it also stimulates real-time movement, which is very important for players who use it for their games. Within just a few clicks, you can teleport yourself to any place in the world without having to need to book a flight. Aside from that, you can ensure the safety of your real location if you use this software.

Another great feature this tool has is that you can even change the speed of your journey. May that be cycling, driving, or walking, you can choose the speed you want to simulate a real-life journey without having to do any steps yourself. They also have a beginner user-friendly interface that will not confuse first-time users

On another note, we will share with you the limitation of the Foneazy MockGo software. Currently, this application is only available for iOS phone users, and Android users. Therefore, you are not able to use this software. Another limitation is that it does not support macOS versions that are older than 10.10. Reaching out to their customer support can also take a long time as they take time to respond to you. Lastly, the software will stop updating, and you will need to check yourself if the software needs to be updated.

## Part 2: How to Fix Foneazy MockGo Not Working Issue

However, while using the Foneazy MockGo software, you will encounter instances where it is not working properly.

Once it says that an update is available, do update the software as the update could contain some fixes for some issues in the software from its previous versions.

**_Option #2:_** Make sure your iOS phone is also updated to the latest version. Double-check if your phone needs updating in the phone settings and update it as needed. If the phone is not updated, it can also hinder some features of the software.

**_Option #3:_** Ensure that your location sharing is enabled on your phone. Despite sharing a spoof location, you will still need to enable your location sharing so the software can track wherever you currently are. You can do this by going to your phone's setting and going to “location” to enable sharing.

**_Option #4:_** Restart your phone or computer. If you have exhausted all the tips we shared, you can try this basic troubleshooting to fix this issue. Usually, just a quick restart on your phone or computer can help to make your Foneazy MockGo work again.
