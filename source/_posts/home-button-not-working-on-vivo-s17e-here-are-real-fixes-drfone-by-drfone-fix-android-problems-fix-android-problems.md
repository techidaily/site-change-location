### Reset Factory settings

If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.

- Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup & Reset”.

- Now, scroll for “Factory Data reset” option and confirm it by clicking “Reset Phone”.
