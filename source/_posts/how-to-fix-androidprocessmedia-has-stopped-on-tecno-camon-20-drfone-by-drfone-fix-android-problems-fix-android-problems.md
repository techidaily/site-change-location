1. First of all, go to “Settings” application from the app drawer or from the notification panel.
2. Now, surf and select for “Applications” or “Apps & notifications”.
3. Here, you need to browse for “Contacts” app and open it.
4. On “Contacts” app, just tap on “CLEAR CACHE” and “CLEAR DATA” button. This will prompt the cache memory to be cleared.

### 2.3 Wipe cache partition

As we know the cache memories are the temporary files build by the firmware. These are of little importance as they are bound to become a bit more corrupted in nature. And sometimes, may indirectly become a hurdle for the working of contacts app. It is good if the Tecno Camon 20 device is cleared off from the caches. Instead of manually wiping down the cache memory, we will understand how to clear off the cache partition in the following steps.
