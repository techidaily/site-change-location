![alternative program](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2022/iphone-data-recovery/banner.png)

If you are searching for an alternative app to the iToolab AnyGo, look no further and check out the [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It is similar to other GPS spoofing apps but promises a smooth, natural, and realistic simulation of any GPS location.

Games are always fun playing with joysticks. And if you play games like Pokemon GO with it, you will experience better and seamless control over your Pokemon character in the simulation.

The app has a low detection rate which prevents you from jailbreaking and avoids getting your account banned. The developers are always alert and constantly updating the app, so you get the most benefit from Dr. Fone Virtual Location. In addition, it is highly compatible with devices running the latest version, so you do not have to worry if the app will work on your device if you are running iOS 17 or Android 12 or later versions.

One great feature that Dr. Fone Virtual Location consists of is sharing your fake location with your family. So you can play pranks with them and have a great time. You can also connect with new friends and get to know their whereabouts.

So much of the talk. If you are wondering how to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app? Here's what you should know. Follow the below step-by-step guide:



### How to use the joystick for flexible and smooth GPS control
