Spotify’s booming audio business is proof that people are in love with its services. If you want to listen to your favorite retro song, or you want to discover the latest hits, Spotify has everything. You can also listen to some really good podcasts and album hits. But what most of us don’t know is that your Spotify Location can determine what kind of content you might come across on the platform.

Your playlist suggestions depend on the country and region you are staying in. And in case you are unable to access any particular song or album, that can be because of your location too, If you are planning on Spotify Change Location, then here are 6 effective ways that will instantly get the job done or you, no matter where you are in the world.

## **Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify**

Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.

**Region Specific Content**

![region specific spotify content](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-Spotify-content-pic1.jpg)

The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.

**Geo-Based Suggestions**

![sopify playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg)

Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.

**But is Spotify available everywhere?**

How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.

The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.

### Method 2: Change location in Google Maps with a VPN

An array of VPN apps come with built-in location spoofing features on top of the usual IP address masking. For example,

### 1\. Nord VPN

NordVPN includes additional features to stay ahead of Hulu’s VPN blocks. It has a Smart DNS tool, to unblock streaming apps on games consoles and Smart TVs, and a functional app for Amazon Fire TV, too, though, it isn’t quite as fast as ExpressVPN, but it’s more than fast enough for HD streaming.

**Pros**

- Affordable price tag
- Useful Smart DNS feature
- IP and DNS leak protection

**Cons**

### 2\. ExpressVPN

ExpressVPN can bypasses many streaming blocks, like Hulu’s, and it delivers a fast long-distance speeds connecting to America from overseas compared to other vpns. Also, it provides many Japanese server locations, including the main big cities in Japan, Tokyo and Osaka.

- Smart DNS tool
- 14 US cities and 3 Janpanese location severs

**Cons**

- More expensive than other VPN providers

### 3\. Surfshark

Surfshark is relatively new to the market and only emerged some time back in 2018. It’s available now at a great price compared to current top dogs in the market.

No matter what VPNs you are using, the steps are basically as same as the following:

- Open a VPN app on your phone.
- Choose a country IP address that you hope to change to.
- Switch the button to make a connection on VPN.
- Refresh or reopen your Google Map, and then input your desired location on its search section.
