How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Realme C53 devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Poco C55 devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device. For spoofing GPS on your mobile devices,Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, works as an excellent tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/images/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Is-pgsharp-legal-when-you-are-playing-pokemon-On-Poco-C55"><a href="#Is-pgsharp-legal-when-you-are-playing-pokemon-On-Poco-C55" class="headerlink" title="Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Poco C55?"></a>Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Poco C55?</h2><p>Pokémon Go is the phenomenon that hit us in 2016 and made us obsessed with the AR game based on real-time location. If you are one of those players who have been to all the local PokeStops in hopes of finding your favorite rare Pokémon, then it might be time for you to consider spoofing your location while playing PoGo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go"                ></p><p>Pokémon Go relies on GPS coordinates and real-time tracking to let players catch Pokémon s in real locations. Hence, spoofing comes to the discussion of “catching them all.”</p><p>‘Spoofing’ location makes your phone, and thereby the game thinks that you’re in another location, which opens up the possibility to catch new and rare Pokémon s from gyms and PokeStops around the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-Pgsharp-legal"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Pgsharp-legal" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?"></a><strong>Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp"                ></p><p>No game developer likes to see their game played in unfair ways. Thus, Niantic (PoGo’s Dev) made some strict rules against exploiting their game, giving some players an unfair advantage over others.</p><p>So, <strong><strong>is PGSharp legal?</strong></strong> No, Spoofing location, in general, is illegal.

However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.</p><p>Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select “Virtual Location” given on the first page of the program.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now, have your iPhone connected to your computer. Then select “Get Started”. Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Enable the “teleport mode” by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone’s GPS to in the text box in the map’s left-upper section. Select “Go”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p>Step 4: Now select “Move here.” And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device.

The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.</li><li>Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)</li><li>After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.</li><li>Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.</li><li>Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.</li></ul><p>Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who’s on a Pokémon hunt.

By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.</p><p>The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone"></a><strong>Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone</strong></h2><p>Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content.

The home location will apply to all the Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device. For spoofing GPS on your mobile devices,Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, works as an excellent tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/images/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="How-To-Simulate-GPS-Movement-With-Location-Spoofer-On-Oppo-Reno-11-Pro-5G"><a href="#How-To-Simulate-GPS-Movement-With-Location-Spoofer-On-Oppo-Reno-11-Pro-5G" class="headerlink" title="How To Simulate GPS Movement With Location Spoofer On Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G?"></a>How To Simulate GPS Movement With Location Spoofer On Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G?</h2><p>When you are playing location-based games like Pokemon Go, you might need to simulate GPS movement to catch more Pokemon. To do this, you can use the GPS movement feature of Wondershare <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This feature allows you to simulate GPS movement between two or multiple spots on the map. Here’s how you can do it:</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h3 id="Part-1-Simulate-Movement-Along-a-Route-One-Stop-Route"><a href="#Part-1-Simulate-Movement-Along-a-Route-One-Stop-Route" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Simulate Movement Along a Route (One-Stop Route)"></a>Part 1: Simulate Movement Along a Route (One-Stop Route)</h3><p>You can set up a one-stop route when <strong>mocking locations fake</strong> with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This particular feature helps users to set up looping or round trips within a specific location. To perform the steps for simulating movement, look ahead for a better understanding:</p><p>Step 1Access One-Stop Route Function</p><p>Once you launch Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and connect your smartphone successfully, proceed to select the <strong>One-Stop Route</strong> function from the top-right section. The function is represented by the third icon from the left in the section. While you have already teleported to another location or are using your current location, you can tap anywhere on the map to set your destination location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="activate one stop route mode"                ></p><p>Step 2Define Simulation Parameters</p><p>Enter a number to define how many times you want to go back and forth, and select whether you want a <strong>Round trip</strong> or a <strong>Loop trip</strong>. Drag the slider on the speed option to set how fast you want to walk. Proceed to click <strong>Move Here</strong> on the bottom to start the movement simulation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="set parameters to simulate"                ></p><p>Step 3Start Simulation Movement</p><p>The respective simulation starts, and you can see your position is moving on the map with the speed you set. If you wish to hold the simulation, click <strong>Pause</strong> or tap <strong>Clear</strong> to revert to your original state.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="start one stop simulation"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Simulate-Movement-Along-a-Route-Multi-Stop-Route"><a href="#Part-2-Simulate-Movement-Along-a-Route-Multi-Stop-Route" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Simulate Movement Along a Route (Multi-Stop Route)"></a>Part 2: Simulate Movement Along a Route (Multi-Stop Route)</h3><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve_I4YgjYno" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>You can try the multi-stop mode if you want to pass by multiple places along a route on the map. Learn how it is done when you are trying to **spoof location on Android&#x2F;**iOS:</p><p>Step 1Start Multi-Stop Route and Set Parameters</p><p>Activate the <strong>Multi-Stop Route</strong> mode from the top-right section next to the One-Stop Route mode. After activating the mode, set multiple spots on the map by clicking your required place. Define the number of trips and speed. Click <strong>Start Moving</strong> to initiate the process.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Select the spots along a specific road to prevent the game developer from thinking you are cheating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="activate multi stop simulation"                ></p><p>Step 2View Multi-Stop Route Movement</p><p>As the simulation starts, click <strong>Pause</strong> at any instance where you want to stop the simulation. You can also <strong>Clear</strong> all settings if required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="execute multi stop route simulation"                ></p><h3 id="Part-3-Use-Joystick-for-More-Flexible-GPS-Control-Joystick-Movement"><a href="#Part-3-Use-Joystick-for-More-Flexible-GPS-Control-Joystick-Movement" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Use Joystick for More Flexible GPS Control (Joystick Movement)"></a>Part 3: Use Joystick for More Flexible GPS Control (Joystick Movement)</h3><p>Dr.Fone has integrated the joystick feature into the Virtual Location program to spare 90% of the labor for GPS control. You can always find the joystick on the lower left part in teleport mode. And you can also click the joystick button in the upper right (the 5th one) to use the joystick feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png"                      alt="try joystick movement for simulation"                ></p><p>The joystick, like one-stop route or multi-stop route modes, aims to facilitate GPS movement on the map. But what’s better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic GPS movement:</strong> Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts. Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.</li><li><strong>Manual GPS movement:</strong> Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard. Reverse by constantly clicking the Down arrow, or long-pressing the key S or Down on the keyboard. You can also tweak the directions using the four ways above before moving forward or reverse.</li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2 id="Can-Life360-Track-You-When-Your-Oppo-Reno-11-Pro-5G-is-off"><a href="#Can-Life360-Track-You-When-Your-Oppo-Reno-11-Pro-5G-is-off" class="headerlink" title="Can Life360 Track You When Your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G is off?"></a>Can Life360 Track You When Your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G is off?</h2><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png"                      alt="avatar"                ></a></p><p>Did you know that your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G tracks your location even when turned off? And if you’re a member of any social media network, it means you could be tracked. Do you like to have your privacy?

But is that true?</p><p>In the event that you switch off your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G, the GPS function will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G is turned off. However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data that was uploaded to your account.</p><p>Should we trust Life360, the social media company that recently merged with Google, to protect our privacy?

Life360 is monitoring software that can be downloaded into your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G and used by the individuals who are part of your Family Circle to monitor your location and the location of anybody else who is part of your Family Circle.</p><p>The app works by sending a request to your cellular carrier to get your location and then sending that information to the Life360 servers. In addition, life360 will store your location and send it to your social networks automatically.</p><p>Life360 is not required to track your location, but it is required to send your location to your social networks.</p><p>If you want to know more about Life360, check out our Life360 Review.</p><p>When it comes to privacy, many people are becoming more aware of how it is being violated. As a result, there’s no need to worry about whether or not the monitoring app in concern is as trustworthy as Life360.</p><p>Disconnecting from Life360 is as simple as turning off your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G and preventing the app from following and reporting your every step. Unfortunately, it also means that no one can see where they are about one another or how long it has been since they last updated their position.</p><p>If the necessity ever arose, such an undertaking may be useful for maintaining one’s privacy. However, customers have no idea that Life 360 may still be used to monitor them by other people.</p><p>Premium users will still have access to the last 30 days’ worth of location data, so the other person will be able to see where you were last seen.</p><h2 id="Part-3-3-Ways-to-Stop-Life360-from-Tracking-You"><a href="#Part-3-3-Ways-to-Stop-Life360-from-Tracking-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You"></a>Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You</h2><h3 id="1-Low-Data-Consumption"><a href="#1-Low-Data-Consumption" class="headerlink" title="1.

Go to the Settings and locate Life360; however, do not deactivate the exact location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg"                      alt="low data consumption"                ></p><p>Alternatively, you should disable background app refresh, mobile network, physical activity, and WIFI to save battery life.

If you don’t want applications updating in the background, enable power-saving mode.</p><p>Use a wired connection. Adolescents can turn off Wi-Fi and data when using the Life360 app on an iPhone. Go to Settings, look for Life360, and disable Cellular Data, Background Refresh, and Motion &amp; Fitness. You’ll be able to keep track of where you are on Life360.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg"                      alt="low data consumption"                ></p><p>All these methods can be used to Stop Life360 from Tracking You.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

Hence, any apps like PGSharp, or Fake GPS Go, used to disguise actual real-time location and fake it, will result in an account ban.</p><p> According to Niantic’s terms and conditions:</p><ul><li>“Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device’s location (for example through GPS spoofing).</li><li>And _”_Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software).”</li></ul><p> If Niantic detects usage of a fake location or GPS spoofing app while playing Pokémon Go, they will impose a strike on your account.</p><ul><li>The first strike would make rare Pokémon s not visible to you for seven days.</li><li>The second strike would temporarily ban you from playing the game for 30 Days.</li><li>The third strike will permanently ban your account.</li></ul><p> You can appeal these strikes to Niantic if you think you’ve been banned without violation of any terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/niantic-warning.jpg"                      alt="niantic-warning"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-ways-to-spoof-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Three-ways-to-spoof-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android"></a><strong><strong>Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android</strong></strong></h2><ol><li><strong>PGSharp :</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp-interface.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp-interface"                ></p><p>PGSharp is one of the most reliable ways to spoof your location while playing Pokémon Go.

The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.</li><li>Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)</li><li>After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.</li><li>Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.</li><li>Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.</li></ul><p>Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who’s on a Pokémon hunt.

Solving the internet issues"></a>1. Solving the internet issues</h3><p>Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.</p><p>If this is the cause of your <strong>3uTools virtual location not working</strong>, there isn’t much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to “Mapbox” to see if it addresses the problem.</p><h3 id="2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software"><a href="#2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="2. Restarting and Closing the Software"></a>2. Restarting and Closing the Software</h3><p>When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg"                      alt="restart the software"                ></p><h3 id="3-3uTools-reinstallation"><a href="#3-3uTools-reinstallation" class="headerlink" title="3. 3uTools reinstallation"></a>3. 3uTools reinstallation</h3><p>The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg"                      alt="reinstall 3utools"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restarting-Your-Computer"><a href="#4-Restarting-Your-Computer" class="headerlink" title="4. Restarting Your Computer"></a>4. Restarting Your Computer</h3><p>Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg"                      alt="restart computer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked"><a href="#5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked" class="headerlink" title="5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked"></a>5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked</h3><p>When you encounter a ‘not working’ problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg"                      alt="verify the netwrok connection"                ></p><h3 id="6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded"><a href="#6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded" class="headerlink" title="6. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded"></a>6. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded</h3><p>Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.</p><h3 id="7-Changing-the-Source-Map"><a href="#7-Changing-the-Source-Map" class="headerlink" title="7. Changing the Source Map"></a>7. Changing the Source Map</h3><p>Users frequently report that the map is not loaded. The maps on the 3uTools software fail to load as soon as users activate the virtual location option. You can attempt “Load embedded maps” to solve this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-6.jpg"                      alt="load embedded maps"                ></p><p>Alternatively, change the source map between Google Maps and Open Street Maps.</p><h3 id="8-Uninstalling-iTunes-and-rebooting-your-system"><a href="#8-Uninstalling-iTunes-and-rebooting-your-system" class="headerlink" title="8.

Uninstalling iTunes and rebooting your system</h3><p>Many customers have reported encountering the “3uTools virtual location developer image load failed” problem, with the majority of them appearing to be iOS 17 users. 3uTools either does not load the location images or the screen becomes frozen.</p><p>Remove iTunes from your computer. Then, try restarting it. Install iTunes from the App Store once more. Restart your computer. After that, connect your iPhone to a PC and confirm that it is unlocked.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-3uTools-Virtual-Location-Alternative-Program-You-Can-Use-in-2024"><a href="#Part-3-Best-3uTools-Virtual-Location-Alternative-Program-You-Can-Use-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best 3uTools Virtual Location Alternative Program You Can Use in 2024"></a>Part 3: Best 3uTools Virtual Location Alternative Program You Can Use in 2024</h2><p>Stop fretting if you frequently encounter the <strong>3uTools virtual location not working</strong> problem despite attempting various fixes.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Poco X6 Pro devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.</p><p>The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.</p><p>However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and <strong><em>run the app on a Windows PC</em></strong>. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.</p><p>These methods include:</p><h2 id="Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator"><a href="#Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator"></a>Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator</h2><p>The first and the most convenient way to run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> is to use an Android Emulator. An emulator is basically a software that creates a virtual Android system on your computer. As a result, you’ll be able to run Android apps on your computer.</p><p>While there are dozens of Android emulators, Bluestacks seems to be the most popular and user-friendly option among all. Unlike other emulators, Bluestacks is easy to set up and use.</p><p>Here’s how you can run <strong><em>Life360 on a computer</em></strong> using Bluestacks Android emulator.&#x2F;</p><p>Step 1: Head over to Bluestacks official website and tap the download button.</p><p>Step 2: Open the installer and tap the “download” button. This will initiate the download process on your System.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-1.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 1"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once the installation process completes, Bluestacks will start to boot. Keep in mind that the first boot may take some time, depending on your system configurations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-2.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 2"                ></p><p>Step 4: In the home screen, tap the “Google Play Store” icon. You’ll be asked to sign-in with your Google account. Enter the right credentials and log-in to the Google Play Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-3.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 13"                ></p><p>Step 5: In the top search bar, type-in Life360 and tap the “install” button to download the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-4.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 5"                ></p><p>Step 6: Life360 is now installed on your computer.

For instance, running an Android emulator is not easy when you have a low-configuration PC. Emulators like Bluestacks requires high system configuration otherwise they take forever to load.</p><p>In this situation, we have another alternative for you to run <strong><em>Life360 on PC</em></strong>. You can simply mirror your Android to your Windows system. Mirroring the Android device will allow you to see its content on the PC itself.</p><p>Here’s how you can mirror the Android device on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on both devices.</p><p>Step 2: On your Windows PC, open “Settings” and select the “Systems” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 1"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose the “Projecting to this PC” option in the left menu-bar and make sure that “Available Everywhere” is selected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-2.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 2"                ></p><p>Step 4: If you’re running Android Pie or above on your device, scroll down to open notification drawer and select “Smart View” (or “Cast” in some devices). You’ll see your PC listed here. Tap the button to start Android mirroring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-3.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 3"                ></p><p>Step 5: It may take some while for the connection to establish. Once it does, you’ll be able to cast your device screen onto your computer and you’ll be able to run life360 on your system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-4.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 4"                ></p><p>Keep in mind that you’ll still require your device to navigate through the content on your computer.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Tecno Pova 5 devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

This has to do with its innovative algorithms and thanks to its user-friendly approach. The process of faking the location involves the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Access Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and Move to Toolbox</strong></p><p>Begin with the launch of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location on your computer and establish a connection with your Android or iOS device. Navigate to the map screen and select the “Teleport Mode” icon, which is situated as the first option in the toolbar near the top-right corner. Now, start the process by tapping the search bar at the top left corner, inputting your desired location, and hitting “Enter.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="select the desired location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Move to the Targeted Location and Verify It</strong></p><p>Upon completion of the initial setup, proceed to teleport to the targeted location by clicking “Move Here” on the map screen. This action prompts the cursor to relocate to the specified location on the map. It also simultaneously adjusts the location of your Android or iOS device. To validate the successful location change, access your smartphone and open a map application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="click the move here button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem"><a href="#Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?"></a>Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?</h2><p>Faking your GPS has its advantages, primarily protecting your privacy.</p><p>However, if you’re on the receiving end of a fake GPS signal, you need to detect any spoofing attempts before it’s too late. You need to have a security measure to ensure data you’re receiving is coming from a legitimate source instead of a malicious one. It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.</p><p>Here are some reasons why your company should be wary of GPS spoofing.</p><p><strong>Food Delivery</strong></p><p>Couriers who use GPS spoofing can trick food delivery apps into allowing them to accept orders they otherwise would not have access to. They may also gain an unfair advantage to gain priority in order queues and report longer rides to earn more from the platform. In addition, a more egregious issue is couriers charging for deliveries that weren’t made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-03.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing on food delivery driver apps"                ></p><p><strong>Gaming</strong></p><p>Using GPS spoofing in MMORPGs enables gamers to take advantage of faking their position without moving into the comforts of their own home. This can lead to more in-game rewards that are otherwise difficult to achieve without GPS spoofing.</p><p>Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.</p><p><strong>Social Media</strong></p><p>Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.</p><p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p><p>Most financial institutions across the globe use location data to verify users to prevent fraud. Having inaccurate data is a major security beach, especially when handling financial service apps on the internet.</p><p>There are various ways to protect yourself from being on the other end of a fake GPS location. You can easily use specialized apps, including <a class="link"   href="https://apkpure.com/mock-location-root-detector/com.check.mock" >mock location detection APKs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you’re on Android. These anti-spoofing GPS apps help detect if someone is providing fake GPS locations. However, if this is not available to you, there are several ways you can mitigate malicious actors by applying some safeguards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-04.jpg"                      alt="mock location detection apks"                ></p><p>Here are some of the methods you can take advantage of.</p><ul><li>Cross-reference location data from multiple sources to detect fake GPS locations. You can cross reference from GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell tower triangulation to analyze accurate GPS.</li><li>Analyze abnormal patterns in location data presented to you from sudden jumps in location or having unrealistic speeds during movement.</li><li>Verify the accuracy of GPS by comparing location data to known landmarks, including buildings, bridges, or roads.</li><li>Using a dedicated GPS simulator and comparing results to expected from provided data.</li><li>Have a security measure to detect GPS spoofing apps installed on a user’s smartphone.</li></ul><p>While the methods to detect GPS locations are presented above, it’s important to remember that detecting fake GPS locations is difficult and requires you to combine different methods. You can easily detect mock locations on Android, but the methods available if you’re on a different device will vary depending on the resources at your disposal.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Faking your GPS is easy nowadays.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Samsung Galaxy M34 5G devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Samsung Galaxy M34 devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Oppo Reno 11F 5G devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="Google-play-store-apps-pic-6"                ></p><p>The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches.

Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Oppo Reno 11F 5G  and Android phones.

Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

This means that you should take care not to be hopping like a bunny from here and there in minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Top-Mock-Location-Apps-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-III-Top-Mock-Location-Apps-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone"></a>Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone</h2><p>There are fewer mock location apps on the Apple Store due to Apple’s strict policies on user privacy and security. Apple prioritizes maintaining a secure and reliable user experience, which limits the availability of apps that could potentially misuse location data. Therefore, this part will mainly introduce five softwares that need to be installed on a computer. Let’s come to the apps! Here are the top location spoofer apps for iPhone.</p><h4 id="1-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS"><a href="#1-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS" class="headerlink" title="1.

How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.</p><p>- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.</p><p>- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.</p><h2 id="Closing-Words"><a href="#Closing-Words" class="headerlink" title="Closing Words"></a>Closing Words</h2><p>Using a mock location app can be fun. You can use it for recreational purposes such as pranking friends. You can use it for practical purposes such as saving money on dating apps by mocking location on Android and iPhones to anywhere around the world to meet new people. You can use it to simulate movement anywhere in the world in location-based games. You can also use mock location apps to effectively change your geographical location to watch content not available in your true geographical area.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Realme GT 5 devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

Dr.Fone will work because it works from your computer and interacts directly with the Realme GT 5 without downloading an app to the Realme GT 5.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>This is how you use Dr.Fone Virtual Location, an iOS 16 Pokémon go spoofer tool, to spoof your location on Realme GT 5:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Launch Dr.Fone</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="wondershare drfone software interface"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose Virtual Location and connect your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="wondershare drfone virtual location module"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click Get Started.

You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Teleporting To Another Location</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start typing your destination location and click Go</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location teleport"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Realme GT 5. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.</p><p><strong>Simulating Movement Between Two Points</strong></p><p>Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here’s how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Realme GT 5 app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type your destination and click Go.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In a new popup, choose if you want to route to repeat and select the number of times. Click Match to start.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p>You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!</p><p><strong>Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points</strong></p><p>Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can’t deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location multi point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Distance gets re-calculated after each selection.

However, anyone can use a location changer on Realme GT 5 for several other benefits such as breaking the geo-restrictions in dating apps and streaming websites to find dates outside your city limits for free and accessing a catalog of movies and TV shows that is not available in your region due to licensing or other considerations. There are several Realme GT 5 location spoofer apps in the market, each extolling its virtues. None of them, however, come close to Wondershare <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> spoofer on Realme GT 5 given its intuitive interface and ease of use. Not only can you use it on iOS 16 without problem as this app works from a computer, but you also do not have to think about security issues that jailbreaking a device brings because Dr.Fone Virtual Location changer on Realme GT 5 works without jailbreaking the Realme GT 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Will-iSpoofer-update-On-Realme-GT-5"><a href="#Will-iSpoofer-update-On-Realme-GT-5" class="headerlink" title="Will iSpoofer update On Realme GT 5"></a>Will iSpoofer update On Realme GT 5</h2><p>iSpoofer has been one of the most in-demand applications for changing your location while playing Pokemon Go. For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="Google-play-store-apps-pic-6"                ></p><p>The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr.Fone Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer for both Android and iPhones.

You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg"                      alt="drfone-change-location-pic-7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned. You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

Fixed"></a>iSpoofer is not working On Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G? Fixed</h2><p>Pokemon Go is one of the most appreciated games across the world. Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1"                ></p><p>However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?</p><p>You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Does-iSpoofer-Still-Work-Why"><a href="#Part-1-Does-iSpoofer-Still-Work-Why" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?"></a><strong>Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?</strong></h2><p>If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2"                ></p><p>Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.</p><p>One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3"                ></p><p>iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.</p><p>So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4"                ></p><p>There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely"><a href="#Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?"></a><strong>Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?</strong></h2><p>If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.</p><p>If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -</p><p><strong>VPNs</strong> - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5"                ></p><p><strong>Apps on App Store</strong> - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a sure shot at changing your location without any hassle, then the best suggestion would be to use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Changer.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Realme C51 devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device. For spoofing GPS on your mobile devices,Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, works as an excellent tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/images/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-error-495-while-downloadupdating-android-apps-on-vivo-y77t-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Error 495 While Download/Updating Android Apps On Vivo Y77t | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/what-pokemon-evolve-with-a-dawn-stone-for-samsung-galaxy-f34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Samsung Galaxy F34 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/top-15-augmented-reality-games-like-pokemon-go-to-play-on-vivo-v29-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 15 Augmented Reality Games Like Pokémon GO To Play On Vivo V29 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-ipogo-will-be-the-new-ispoofer-on-samsung-galaxy-f34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Samsung Galaxy F34 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-samsung-galaxy-m34-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What Legendaries Are In Pokemon Platinum On Samsung Galaxy M34? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-use-pokemon-emerald-master-ball-cheat-on-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Use Pokémon Emerald Master Ball Cheat On Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-hand-held-balance-for-sharp-images/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Hand-Held Balance for Sharp Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-visualrecorder-your-yearly-guide-to-screen-captures/"><u>[Updated] VisualRecorder  Your Yearly Guide to Screen Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transcription-and-task-execution-on-the-go-fee-free/"><u>2024 Approved  Transcription and Task Execution on the Go – Fee-Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-pokemon-emerald-master-ball-cheat-on-tecno-spark-10-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Use Pokémon Emerald Master Ball Cheat On Tecno Spark 10 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-selection-best-8-websites-with-striking-3d-and-glamourous-text/"><u>[New] Ultimate Selection  Best 8 Websites with Striking 3D & Glamourous Text</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-the-crazy-crews-top-10-unique-tiktok-games/"><u>[Updated] The Crazy Crew's Top 10 Unique TikTok Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-viral-video-marketing/"><u>Mastering the Art of Viral Video Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-guide-on-oppo-a78-5g-frp-bypass-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Guide on Oppo A78 5G FRP Bypass</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.</p><p>- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.</p><p>- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour.

The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Realme C67 4G devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Realme C67 4G keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Poco C51 devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server.

Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.
